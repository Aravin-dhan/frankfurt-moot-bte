All events within the Facts section of this case-study are historical unless stated\notherwise. The footnotes provided in the Facts section do not form part of the case-study but\nare added only for editorial reasons. The arbitrations and the facts mentioned in the Disputes\nsection were invented for purposes of the Moot. Provisions from and authorities on national\nlaws will not be relevant for the purposes of the Moot unless they are quoted in verbatim in this\ncase-study or concern the English Arbitration Act. The participants are to assume that all\nsources of and authorities on international law and the English Arbitration Act as of 1 June 2026\napplied throughout the events described below.\nThe Facts\n2. Long before the United States of America (the “USA”) joined World War I as a\ncombatant on 6 April 1917, the American armaments industry had been producing military\nequipment and munitions for the Entente States. The pier of the peninsula Black Tom Island in\nNew York Harbor was the largest transshipment point in the USA for shipments of arms and\nmunition to Europe. Trains from the factories in Pennsylvania and New York State arrived at\nthe pier. Their cargo was loaded onto barges and then transferred to larger ships bound for\nEurope. The Lehigh Valley Railroad Company (“LVRR”) operated by Black Tom pier together\nwith a subsidiary, the National Docks and Railway Company.\n3. Founded on 21 April 1846, LVRR got its name in 1853 under the leadership of\nentrepreneur Asa Packer. Holding a quarter of LVRR’s stock, he started to build a railroad\nnetwork which would stretch from the Great Lakes to New York Harbor by the end of the\n19th century.\n4. In 1879, Asa Packer died. J.P. Morgan & Co. took his place and continued to drive\nthe expansion.\n5. On 3 October 1890, the Russian Prince Sergei Platonovich Obolensky Neledinsky-\nMeletzky, known as Serge Obolensky was born.\n6. At the turn of the century, the economic prosperity of LVRR attracted many investors.\nIn 1904, regular 10% dividends were revived.\n\n7. In December 1910, the company’s stock capitalization was doubled from $ 40,000,000\nto $ 80,000,000.  The company issued and sold shares for $ 50 per share. J.P. Morgan & Co.\nwould continue to hold a quarter of the stock until the mid-1920s.\n8. In 1915/1916, LVRR was an important carrier for the military industry. Despite an\nordinance of Jersey City prohibiting the shipment of explosives within the city limits, LVRR\nhad for some time been moving tons of munitions to its waterfront terminal on Black Tom\nIsland. Since the departures of the ships could not always be planned, ammunition and\nexplosives were often stored in waggons on site for up to a week.\n9. On 30 July 1916, shortly after midnight, a fire broke out on Black Tom Island. At 2:08\nam, the whole area of New York Harbor was shaken by a large explosion. That explosion was\nheard even 100 miles away. At 2:40 am, a second blast followed. Tons of ammunition and other\nexplosives exploded, claiming the lives of at least four people and damaging the surrounding\n(including the Statue of Liberty) heavily. The ammunition and explosives included a very large\nshipment to be delivered to the Russian Empire. The total property damage resulting from the\nexplosion ran to an estimated $ 20,000,000 (the “Black Tom Explosion”).\n10. One day later, investigations against the local officials of LVRR at Black Tom Island\nbegan. The background was that LVRR’s security measures at Black Tom Island were not\nstrict. At night, the pier was guarded by six guards from LVRR and four guards paid by the\nRussian Empire and the British Empire, but there were no gates or other physical barriers to\nstop intruders. In addition, LVRR did not keep a locomotive on standby to move cars quickly\nin the event of a fire thereby violating the fire safety regulations of the US Interstate Commerce\nCommission. Despite a growing number of incidents regarding the production and the\nshipment of war related materials in 1916, the investigators did not attribute the explosions to\nsabotage.\n\n11. In 1917, two revolutions happened in Russia. The February Revolution of 1917 led to\nthe fall of the Imperial Government. The so-called Provisional Government of Prince Georgy\nYevgenyevich Lvov succeeded.\n12. On 22 March 1917, the USA recognized this Government.\n13. During the October Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks took over, ousting the\nProvisional Government.\n14. From November 1916 to April 1917, LVRR employed a detective agency to shadow a\nman called Michael Kristoff, who was suspected to be an arsonist and involved in the Black\nTom Explosion. LVRR received the agency’s reports but kept them confidential.\n15. On 3 February 1918, the Bolshevik Government adopted a decree repudiating all debts\ncontracted by the Imperial and the Provisional Government. Under this decree, the Bolshevik\nGovernment cancelled all foreign debt owed by the Russian Empire.\n16. On 21 March 1918, US Congress enacted the Railway Administration Act. Congress\nreleased the budgetary funds for a measure by which US President Woodrow Wilson had\nordered most US railroads to be taken into State possession. The rationale for this measure\nwas that the Black Tom Explosion and other incidents had shown that the railroad companies\nwere unable to solve war-related problems such as congestion of tracks and lack of storage\nfacilities. A government agency assumed control over LVRR’s tracks, port terminals and\nrolling stock. Pursuant to the Act, LVRR received “as just compensation an annual sum […]\nnot exceeding a sum equivalent as nearly as may be to its average annual railway operating\nincome for the three years ended June nineteen hundred and seventeen.”\n17. On 21 July 1918, a German submarine damaged a tugboat owned by LVRR off the east\ncoast of Massachusetts. LVRR notified the Secretary of State of the damage suffered from\nthis attack.\n\n18. On 23 July 1918, Boris Bakhmetev, the ambassador of the Provisional Russian\nGovernment to the USA, began proceedings against LVRR. He acted on behalf of the “State of\nRussia”, as he put it in his claim, before the US District Court of New York. He claimed\ndamages for the shipment not delivered to Russia as a result of the Black Tom Explosion. He\nargued that LVRR acted negligently in the handling of the explosives at Black Tom Island. He\nalso emphasized that a considerable part of the munitions destroyed at Black Tom Island had\nalready been owned by the Imperial Russian Government before the Black Tom Explosion.\n19. In October 1918, Prince Obolensky fled Russia after he had fought as an officer against\nthe Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War and, before that, against the Germans during World\nWar I. First, he stayed in Western Europe.\n20. On 27 January 1919, LVRR’s motion to dismiss the action “on the ground that there\nwas not in existence 'the Russian government,' and therefore no plaintiff” was rejected by the\nUS District Court of New York. The Court reasoned:\n“It may be observed that the importance of recognizing governmental\ncontinuity, quite irrespective of considerations as to the existing form\nof a foreign government, or as to the human beings in control at any\nparticular time, is well illustrated in this case, where it is sought to\ndeprive a foreign state forever of the opportunity to be heard in an effort\nto recover for the loss of property which belonged to the foreign state;\ni.e., the “Russian government,” by whatever name called. It may also\nbe noted, in passing, that the executive and judicial branches of the\ngovernment have recognized “the present government of Russian” in\nproceedings to naturalize Russian subjects. Since the fall of the Imperial\nRussian government, such applicants for citizenship forswear\nallegiance to “the present government of Russia.”\n21. In addition to the lawsuit brought by the “State of Russia”, eleven civil lawsuits were\nfiled against LVRR in connection with the Black Tom Explosion. LVRR denied any external\ncause for the explosions in court. LVRR relied upon a theory of spontaneous combustion in its\ndefence. In the proceedings, LVRR did not submit the detective agency’s reports on Mr.\nKristoff as evidence.\n22. On 28 June 1919, the Peace Treaty of Versailles was signed between Germany and the\n“Allied and Associated Powers” (USA, the British Empire, France, Italy, Japan, Belgium,\nBolivia, Brazil, China, Cuba, Ecuador, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, The Hedjaz, Honduras,\nLiberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, The Serb-Croat-Slovene State,\nSiam, Czecho-Slovakia and Uruguay) (the “Treaty of Versailles”). The Treaty of Versailles\nimposed reparations on Germany for “all the loss and damage to which the Allied and\nAssociated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence” of World\nWar I. In addition, it established the League of Nations. Absent Congress’ consent, the USA\ndid not ratify the Peace Treaty of Versailles.\n23. On 1 March 1920, the Transportation Act ended the USA’s State possession over the\nUS railroads and reestablished private control over them.\n24. On 25 August 1921, the USA and Germany signed a separate treaty, the Treaty\nconcerning the re-establishment of Peace between Germany and the United States of America\n(the “Treaty of Berlin”), which entered into force on 11 November 1921. The Treaty of Berlin\nincorporated by reference most of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, in particular\nGermany’s obligation to pay reparations.\n25. On 15 December 1921, the Bolshevik Government issued a decree “On the deprivation\nof citizenship rights of certain categories of persons abroad” (Decree No. 11). It stated:\n“1. Persons in the categories listed below who are abroad after the publication of\nthis resolution shall be deprived of Russian citizenship: […]\nb) Persons who left Russia after November 7, 1917, without permission from the\nSoviet authorities.\nc) Persons who voluntarily served in armies that fought against the Soviet power or\nparticipated in any form in counter-revolutionary organizations. […]\n2. Persons named in subparagraphs “b” and “c” of Article 1 may, until June 1,1922,\nsubmit applications for the restoration of their rights to the All-Russian Central\nExecutive Committee through the nearest representative offices.”\n26. Prince Obolensky did not apply for the restoration of his Russian citizenship under\nthis Decree.\n\n27. On 16 April 1922, Germany was the first major State to recognize the new Bolshevik\nGovernment. It signed the Treaty of Rapallo with the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet\nRepublic, which would form the core of the Soviet Union founded at the end of the year.\n28. On 10 August 1922, the USA and Germany signed the Supplementary Agreement to the\nTreaty of Berlin (the “Supplementary Agreement”). The two States agreed to submit the\ndeterminations of all reparations under the Treaty of Berlin to a Mixed Claims Commission\n(the “MCC”). Pursuant to Article 1 (2) of the Supplementary Agreement, the MCC should\ndecide – amongst others – the following category of claim:\n“[…] claims for loss or damage to which the United States or its nationals have\nbeen subjected with respect to injuries to persons, or to property, rights and\ninterests, including any company or association in which American nationals are\ninterested, since July 31, 1914, as a consequence of the war”.\n29. Article 2 sentence 1 of the Supplementary Agreement stated:\n“The Government of Germany and the Government of the United States shall each\nappoint one Commissioner. The two Governments shall by agreement select an\nUmpire to decide upon any cases concerning which the Commissioners may\ndisagree, or upon any points of difference that may arise in the course of their\nproceedings.”\n30. Germany appointed Wilhelm Kiesselbach as Commissioner. The USA appointed Edwin\nParker as Commissioner. Due to Germany’s limited negotiation power, the Umpire was selected\nde facto by the USA. The Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court, William Day, became\nthe Umpire.\n31. Article 6 (1) of the Supplementary Agreement stipulated that Germany and the USA\ncould designate State Agents “who may present oral or written arguments to the commission.”\n32. On 15 November 1922, the MCC adopted its Rules of Procedure.\n33. On 15 May 1923, Umpire Day resigned. The former Commissioner Parker became the\nnew Umpire. The USA appointed Chandler Anderson as new Commissioner.\n\n34. On 1 November 1923, the MCC adopted its Administrative Decision II.\nAdministrative Decision II specified the parties before the MCC:\n“Though conducted in [sic] behalf of their respective citizens, governments are the\nreal parties to international arbitrations. All claims, therefore, presented to this\nCommission shall be asserted and controlled by the United States as claimant, either\non its own behalf or on behalf of one or more of its nationals. If in the decisions,\nopinions and proceedings of the Commission American nationals are referred to as\nclaimants it will be understood that this is for the purpose of convenient designation\nand that the Government of the United States is the actual claimant.”\n35. Under this provision, the US Agent had the competence to make the final decisions\nregarding questions of strategy and arguments regarding its citizens’ claims. Private US\nclaimants submitted a form containing information to the State Department. The private US\nclaimants were also able to draft briefs for the State Agent’s considerations. However, the latter\nmade the final decisions.\n36. One of the claims by US claimants against Germany, listed as claim No. 11,333, was\nLVRR’s case of its tugboat damaged by a German submarine.\n37. On 25 January 1924, LVRR requested to add its asserted damages claim arising out of\nthe Black Tom Explosion to claim No. 11,333 . LVRR argued that it had obtained new\nevidence that German agents were responsible for the Black Tom Explosion. 82 other\nclaimants also brought damages claims against Germany due to the Black Tom Explosion,\nmainly insurance companies and the relatives of the four persons deceased during the Black\nTom Explosion. These claims were heard together. In the following, the claims of LVRR and\nthe 82 other claimants regarding the Black Tom Explosion will be addressed together as the\n“Sabotage Claims”.\n38. On 1 February 1924, the United Kingdom recognized the Soviet government.\n39. On 13 April 1925, the German Agent informed the US Agent that he would not object\nto the Sabotage Claims being included in the list of cases to be dealt with by the MCC.\n\n40. On 2 July 1925, the US District Court of New York ruled in the case of the “State of\nRussia” against LVRR holding that LVRR failed to exercise due care as a carrier. The Court\nordered LVRR to pay $ 984,104.62 to the “State of Russia” as compensation for its property\ndestroyed in the Black Tom Explosion.\n41. On 8 August 1927, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected the appeal\nagainst the judgment of the US District Court of New York.\n42. Afterwards, LVRR transferred $ 984,104.62 to a bank account controlled by the last\nremaining representative of the Provisional Government, financial attaché Serge Ughet. At the\ntime, the USA did not recognize the Government of the Soviet Union as the legitimate Russian\ngovernment. After deducting the attorneys’ fees, Serge Ughet transferred the remainder of the\n$ 984,104.62 to the US Treasury as a payment towards the Russian Empire’s debts towards\nthe USA.\n43. Afterwards, the Soviet Union sent a telegram to the US Secretary of State stating:\n“taking into consideration the fact that Ughet had no authority whatever from the\npresent Government of the State, previously known as the Russian Empire, the\nGovernment of the Soviet Union protests against the payment to a private person\nof money belonging to the former Russian Treasury, the application of which to any\naccount can only be made with the sanction of the sole lawful owner of such money,\nnamely, the Soviet Union as represented by its Government.”\n44. On 11 March 1928, the US President approved Congress’ “Settlement of War Claims\nAct of 1928”. The act regulated the further procedure on the German property confiscated by\nthe USA during World War I. 80% of the seized property should be returned to the German\nowners. The remaining 20% should remain in the custody of the Secretary of the Treasury as\nsecurity for the claims determined by the Mixed Claims Commission.\n45. In 1929, Prince Obolensky permanently moved to the USA.\n46. On 3 April 1929, the oral hearing in the Sabotage Claims began. The MCC assessed\ndocumentary evidence, witness testimonies and expert opinions. For instance, the US Agent\nsubmitted parts of LVRR’s detective agency’s reports on Mr. Kristoff as evidence. Mr. Kristoff\nhimself had already died and could not be interrogated.\n\n47. On 30 October 1929, Umpire Parker died. On 9 January 1930, he was replaced by\nRoland Boyden, who had to familiarise himself with the case material.\n48. On 16 October 1930, the MCC held in its award:\n“[A.] In speaking […] we have not the least intention to raise any doubt as to the\nentire good faith of the present German Government in its management and\npresentation of these cases, nor of the Agent who has represented Germany as\ncounsel. And in order that this last statement may not be construed as merely\nconventional courtesy, we state specifically that we have no such doubts. We\nbelieve that the present German Government was entirely prepared to bring out the\ntruth and to take the consequences, whatever they might be.\n[B.] It is unnecessary to go further and determine whether such sabotage was the\ngeneral policy of the then German Government. […]There was an admitted policy\nto destroy and damage property of the nations at war with Germany at this time and\nlater, and it is obvious that such acts if committed in or from the United States were\nserious violations of neutrality, that agents engaged therein were not likely to\ndiscriminate very carefully between acts on United States territory and acts outside\nthe United States, or between property belonging to Germany’s enemies and\nproperty not yet delivered, but intended for Germany’s enemies. But in general we\nare all inclined to the opinion that Germany’s diplomatic representatives in the\nUnited States were averse to attacks on American property […]. And up to the entry\nof the United States into the war there were in the United States certain German\nagents who were, or at least pretended to be, active in sabotage work. But we are\nalso convinced that the number of agents so engaged was always small in proportion\nto the field to be covered, that they were never organized effectively, and that their\nnumbers and effectiveness continually decreased […]. […]\n[C.] Hilken and Herrmann are both liars, not presumptive but proven. No one could\nin the light of all their evidence believe anything either says unless something other\nthan his own assertion confirmed his statements. […]\n[D.] So far as we can see, the circumstances of the fire leave the question of its\ncause open. It may have been some fault in the preparation of the powder in the\nshells in this car; it may have come from some other cause connected with\nexplosives, for though we know of no cause which would naturally be suggested by\nthe supposed contents of this car we are suspicious of explosives in general; it may\nhave come from some other accident of which no evidence appears; of course the\nfire may have been of incendiary origin, and in this connection it may be noted that\nall incendiaries are not German agents. […]\n\n[E.] Suspicion was focussed very early on Kristoff in connection with Black Tom.\n[His aunt] said that she at some earlier time saw something like a blueprint or\nblueprints in Kristoff’s room, when he was in her house, and that in his absence she\nonce read a letter, which he had written but had not yet sent, to a man named\nGrandson or Grandor, demanding a large sum of money. […]\n[F.] The name Grantnor is of great significance in this case. The connection between\nKristoff and Hinsch, who was a German agent and who is alleged to have used\nKristoff as his tool in Black Tom, depends substantially on whether Hinsch used\nthe name Grantnor as an alias. […] According to Kristoff, Grantnor met him in the\nPennsylvania Station in New York, asked him the time, got to talking, and then and\nthere employed him to take with him a long trip covering many cities, including\ncities as far west as Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis […]. Kristoff knew nothing\nwhatever about what Grantnor did on these trips, except that Grantnor told him he\nwas trying to get contracts. Grantnor had two suitcases which Kristoff said\ncontained plans and blueprints. Kristoff’s sole duties were to carry the suitcases and\nto watch them when Grantnor was not in his room. […] The story is suspicious\nenough in all conscience. If Grantnor can be shown to be Hinsch, we can easily get\na good deal of truth out of the story and add a good deal of detail. Hinsch himself\ntestifies that he never went further west than Gettysburg. […]\n[G.] We have not all of [the detective agency’s] reports. Why we do not know. We\nget the impression that the reports we have […] were selected and put together in\nthe shape submitted to us. […] Whatever the explanation, the reports as submitted\nto us omit much that seems important to us. [….] And [the detective], entirely\nunconsciously, discredits every admission by Kristoff which appears in his reports\n[…]. […] One singular omission is that Kristoff does not congregate with other\nGerman agents. The urge to congregate is in all the other testimony the most marked\ncharacteristic of all German agents. But we hear nothing of Kristoff’s meeting other\nGerman agents or even sympathizers.”\n49. The MCC rejected the claims and concluded:\n“We cannot be sure that Kristoff did not set fire to Black Tom or take some part in\nso doing. […] But it will sufficiently appear from the foregoing that, as we have\nsaid, the evidence falls far short of enabling us to reach the point, not merely of\nholding Germany responsible for the fire, but of thinking that her agents must have\nbeen the cause, even though the proof is lacking.”\n\n50. On 12 January 1931, the US Agent filed the First Petition for Rehearing. He argued that\na procedural error had taken place because the Umpire not only participated in the deliberations\nbut also co-signed the judgment. The US Agent argued that this violated Art. 2 of the\nSupplementary Agreement which addresses “their [the Commissioners’] proceedings.”\n51. LVRR criticized the award as a “political decision”.\n52. On 30 March 1931, the MCC rejected the application for rehearing unanimously by\nreferring to its consuetudo:\n“The Umpire participated in the deliberations of the Commissioners and in the\nopinion in accordance with the usual practice of the Commission in cases of\nimportance since its foundation in 1922, a practice never before questioned and not\nin our judgment of doubtful validity even if it had not so long been accepted by all\nconcerned.”\n53. From 1 July 1931 onwards, LVRR discontinued dividend payments.\n54. On 1 July 1931, the US Agent filed the Second Petition for Rehearing. He argued that\nnew evidence would proof that the MCC incorrectly dismissed Germany’s responsibility for\nthe Black Tom Explosion. The new evidence submitted by the US Agent included an issue of\nthe Blue Book magazine of January 1917 containing a code message (written with lemon juice)\nforwarded by Fred Herrmann who had fled to Mexico to Paul Hilken in Baltimore, the so called\n“Herrmann Message”. Both Frederick Herrmann and Paul Hilken served as German\noperatives in the USA. According to the US Agent, Paul Hilken only discovered the Herrmann\nMessage in December 1930 in his attic. The Herrmann Message stated the following:\n“Have seen Eckhardt he is suspicious of me Can’t convince him I come\nfrom Maguerre and Nadolny Have told him all reference Hinsch and I\nDeutschland, Jersey City Terminal, Kingsland, Savannah, and Tony’s\nLab. he doubts me on account of my bum German Confirm to him thru\nyour channels all O.K. and my mission here I have no funds Eckhardt\nclaims he is short of money send ly [by] bearer U.S. 25000.— Have you\nheard from Willie Have wired Hildegard but no answer Be careful of\nher and connections Where are Hinsch and Carl Ahrendt Tell Hinsch to\ncome here I expect to go north but he can locate me thru Eckhardt I dont\ntrust Carl Ahrendt, Kristoff, Wolfgang and that Hoboken bunch If\ncornered they might get us in Dutch with authorities See that Hinsch\nbrings with him all who might implicate us tell him Siegel is with me.\nWhere is Carl D. he worries me remember past experience Has Hinsch\n\nseen Wozniak Tell him to fix that up. If you have any difficulties see\nPhil Wirth Nat Arts Club Tell Hinsch his plan O. K.

Most important send funds Bearer will\nrelate experiencies and details Greetings.”\n55. On 24 September 1931, Mr. Obolensky became a national of the USA.\n56. On 29 March 1932, Supreme Court Associate Justice Owen Roberts was appointed as\nnew Umpire after Boyden had passed away in October 1931.\n57. On 3 December 1932, the MCC dismissed the US Agent’s Second Petition for\nRehearing. The Umpire reasoned:\n“[A.] [The] only questions now to be dealt with are those raised by the submission\nof new evidence, and the Commission, accordingly, will not re-examine the\nfindings of fact made in its original decision of October 16, 1930, unless the\nCommission decides that it has jurisdiction to reopen these cases and the new\nevidence now submitted requires reversal or modification of such findings of fact.\n[…]\n[B.] The American Commissioner and the German Commissioner have been unable\nto agree upon the decision of the questions presented in these cases as aforesaid,\nand their respective opinions having been stated to the Umpire they accordingly\ncertify the above mentioned cases and all the questions arising under the\nsupplemental petition therein to the Umpire of the Commission for decision, except\nthat the German Commissioner takes the position that the question of the\njurisdiction of the Commission to re-examine any case after a final decision has\nbeen rendered is not a proper question to be certified to the Umpire on disagreement\nof the National Commissioners and reserves that question from this certificate. […]\n[C.] A glance through this translation will indicate that, without reference to any\nother evidence, it is conclusive proof to any reasonable man that (a) Herrmann and\nHilken knew […] the Black Tom explosion [was] the work of German agents and\n(b) that Hinsch, Hilken, and Herrmann, undoubted agents, were privy thereto, and\n[…] (c) that Kristoff [was active participant]. […]. I may utterly disregard all the\n\nnew evidence produced and still, if I deem this message genuine, hold Germany\nresponsible […]. [But the] authenticity of the message is sharply challenged. […]\n[D.] As respects the production of the [Herrmann] message, I find that it comes\nfrom a source which the Commission has held unworthy of belief, and under\ncircumstances which at least cause me to hesitate to give full faith and credit to the\naccount of its discovery. […]\n[E.] The magazine [containing the Herrmann-Message] was produced by Paul\nHilken […]. The document comes, therefore, from a source which the former\nopinion of the Commission entirely discredited. Hilken, though an American\ncitizen, is a former German agent. His attitude at first was that of loyalty to\nGermany. In December, 1928, he changed his position and testified at great length\non behalf of the claimants. […] In an affidavit made November 15, 1932, Hilken\nstates that on Christmas Day, 1930, he made a search of the attic of his old home in\nBaltimore and unearthed the magazine at the bottom of a wooden box in a closet\nunder the eaves, and at the same time discovered a large amount of correspondence\nbearing on his wartime activities. Apparently none of this other matter was\ndelivered to the claimants with the magazine, but was filed with a later affidavit of\nHilken dated June 29, 1931. Along with Hilken’s affidavit of November 15, 1932,\nwere filed affidavits bearing date November 12 and 15, by Mrs. Hilken. Hilken’s\ndaughter, and Elizabeth Braun. […]\n[F.] Elizabeth Braun, who is in no way identified to the Commission, […] says that\nHilken told her of the finding of an important message and described it; she does\nnot say that she saw it. All of these witnesses seem to have communicated the\ncontents of their affidavits to the claimants during early or late 1931, but their\ntestimony was not submitted to the Commission until November 15,1932. Hilken,\n[…] gives as his reason for not promptly producing the message on its discovery,\nthat he feared publicity as he knew that certain articles were being prepared on the\nsabotage cases to appear in the Liberty magazine. As respects the production of the\nmessage, I find that it comes from a source which the Commission has held\nunworthy of belief, and under circumstances which at least cause me to hesitate to\ngive full faith and credit to the account of its discovery. […]\n[G.] [E]nough has been said to show in how extraordinary a manner this document\ndovetails with all the important and disputed points of claimants’ case and how pat\nall these references are, not to the request for funds but to the claimants’ points of\nproof, — this aside from the absurdity of sending this unnecessary information into\nan enemy country to a suspected spy then under surveillance. […]\n[H.] As it is my opinion that if the new evidence were formally placed on file and\nconsidered in connection with the whole body of evidence submitted prior to the\nCommission’s opinion of October 16, 1930, the findings then made and the\n\nconclusions then reached would not be reversed or materially modified, the\nquestion as to our jurisdiction need not be answered. The supplemental petition for\nrehearing is dismissed.”\n58. For the year of 1932, LVRR reported a deficit in net income of $ 3,933,000. LVRR\ncontinued to operate at a loss until 1935.\n59. On 16 November 1933, the USA recognized the Soviet government.\n60. On 15 December 1933, the MCC decided on the US Agent’s Third Petition for\nRehearing in the Sabotage Claims based on further new evidence which should proof that the\nMCC had been misled by fraud and collusion on the part of witnesses and suppression of\nevidence. Following the Commissioners’ disagreement, the Umpire decided to sustain the\nPetition. The Umpire reasoned:\n“[A.] No tribunal worthy its name or of any respect may allow its decision to stand\nif such allegations are well-founded. Every tribunal has inherent power to reopen\nand to revise a decision induced by fraud. If it may correct its own errors and\nmistakes, a fortiori it may, while it still has jurisdiction of a cause, correct errors\ninto which it has been led by fraud and collusion.\n[B.] I am of opinion, therefore, that the Commission has power to reopen these\ncases, and should do so in order that it may consider the further evidence tendered\nby the American Agent and, dependent upon its findings from that evidence and\nany that may be offered in reply on behalf of Germany, either confirm the decisions\nheretofore made or alter them as justice and right may demand.”\n61. On 24 March 1934, Germany appointed Victor Huecking as new German Commissioner\nto the MCC. Mr. Kiesselbach had previously resigned, possibly under pressure from the\nNational Socialist German government.\n62. On 18 September 1934, the League of Nations adopted a resolution on the admission of\nthe Soviet Union.\n\n63. Later in 1936, Commissioner Anderson passed away. The USA appointed Christopher\nGarnett as Commissioner. The appointment was in the public domain from this time onwards.\n64. On 1 March 1939, Commissioner Huecking resigned, accusing Umpire Roberts of\nbias. The German Foreign Office did not appoint a new Commissioner. The US side was\nconvinced that the resignation only happened to stop further action by the MCC.\n65. On 10 June 1939, the German Chargé d’Affaires to the USA, Hans Thomsen, stated\nGermany’s position on the further proceedings in the MCC in a letter to the US Secretary\nof State:\n“As the German Agent […] reports, a written notice from the American Secretary\nof the Commission, according to which the Commission will hold a meeting at II\na.m. on June 15th […], was received by him on June 7th, of this year. By direction\nof my Government, I call attention to the fact that since the withdrawal of the\nGerman Commissioner, […], of which I notified the American Government by a\nnote to your Excellency of March 24th of this year, the Commission has been\nincompetent to make decisions and that consequently […] there is no legal basis for\na meeting of the Commission at this stage. By direction of my Government, I advise\nyou that [it] will ignore the decision to call the meeting on June 15th, as well as any\nother act of the Commission that might take place in violation of the International\nAgreement of August 10, 1922 and the generally established rules of procedure.”\n66. On 15 June 1939, the truncated MCC consisting of US Commissioner Garnett and\nUmpire Roberts rendered its Award holding Germany liable in the Sabotage Claims:\n“[A.] By reference to the Summary and Conclusions on the Question of Fraud […],\nit will be ascertained that the pleadings filed on behalf of Germany were false, and\nwere known to be false, in claiming that Germany had never authorized sabotage in\nneutral countries nor in the United States during its neutrality, and in claiming that,\nthough men and material for sabotage were sent to the United States in 1916,\ndefinite instructions had been given limiting and prohibiting activity until the time\nwhen the United States should enter the war. […] In order to substantiate\nGermany’s false pleadings Hinsch made many false statements upon which the\nCommission relied in its opinions. In order to attack the Herrmann message, he was\nguilty of the basest forms of prevarication, and upon these the Commission relied\nin its decisions [in 1930 and] in 1932. […]\n\n[B.] [In its decision in 1932], the Commission was unanimously of opinion that, if\nthe authenticity of the Herrmann message be accepted, this would conclusively\nprove the liability of Germany […]. The final conclusions in these cases, therefore,\nmay be stated as follows:\n[C.] (1) The decision of October 16, 1930 […] must be set aside, revoked and\nannulled; and the cases reinstated in the position they were before that decision was\nrendered. (2) Since the authenticity of the Herrmann message has been established,\nthe liability of Germany in […] the Black Tom case […] has now been clearly\nestablished by the record […].”\n67. As to the procedural questions, Mr. Roberts stated the following:\n“1. Within the meaning and intent of the agreement by which the Commission was\nconstituted and its powers defined, there exists a disagreement between the two\nnational commissioners. As I participated with them in the conferences after\nsubmission of the cases, I am cognizant of the disagreement, which makes it my\nduty to act in the decision of the cases. […] Accordingly I record my opinion as\nUmpire.\n2. I concur in the views expressed by the American Commissioner to the effect that\nthe withdrawal of the German Commissioner, after submission by the parties, and\nafter the tribunal, having taken the cases under advisement, pursuant to its rules,\nwas engaged in the task of deciding the issues presented, did not oust the\njurisdiction of the Commission. […] I hold that the Commission as now constituted\nhas jurisdiction to decide the pending motions.”\n68. On 3 October 1939, Mr. Thomsen reacted to the award:\n“[A.] The German Government regrets all the more to have to make protests against\nthis procedure, because the [MCC] could look back upon a model success in\nworking, which had been made possible by confidential and friendly collaboration\n[…]. It is characteristic of the spirit […] that the claims of the Lehigh Valley\nRailroad Company arising out of the explosion at the Black Tom Terminal […]\nwere admitted into the proceedings before the [MCC] only because […] of\nvoluntary admission by the German Government, after delay in submission. The\nGerman Government could have decisively excluded any discussion of these claims\nby referring to their delayed submission and the incompetence of the Commission\narising therefrom. […]\n\n[B.] In order that no doubt may arise as to the view of the German Government, it\nis emphasized that in none of its communications has it taken the stand that by the\nwithdrawal of the German Commissioner the Commission has become ‘functus\nofficio’ and has thereby lost its competence. The sole conclusive question here is\nwhether during the vacancy in the position of the German Commissioner the\nAmerican Commissioner, whether alone or jointly with the American Umpire, can\nexercise functions which the governmental agreement has entrusted to the two\nNational Commissioners for joint exercise. […]\n[C.] [T]he acts and orders of the American Umpire and the American Commissioner\nsince March 1, 1939, among them the reopening of the proceedings in the Black\nTom and Kingsland cases, the ‘decision’ of the Umpire and the American\nCommissioner on the responsibility of Germany in both cases, and the arbitrary\ngranting of awards by the American Umpire, are null and void. Any awards which\nthe American Umpire and the American Commissioner might issue on the basis of\nthese measures are likewise null and void.”\n69. On 30 October 1939, the MCC determined the final sum of damages in the Sabotage\nClaims. The claim of LVRR was granted in the amount of $ 9,900,322. This sum included the\n$ 984,104.62 paid by LVRR to the Russian claimant in the litigation. With interest at 5 % this\namounted to $ 21,396,444. This would be the MCC’s last decision. Since 1923, it had dealt\nwith 20,433 claims, of which it recognised 7,025.\n70. In January 1941, the US Treasury Department began paying out the sum awarded to\nLVRR. Germany had refused to pay and the remaining sum of the German funds available to\nthe US Treasury Department in the framework of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928\ndid not cover the whole award. Therefore, LVRR received only a sum significantly below the\namount awarded in the MCC’s award of 30 October 1939. For purposes of the Moot, the\nparticipants are to assume that LVRR received exactly $ 9,900,322 corresponding to LVRR’s\nmain claim without interest.\n\n71. On selected dates of the above events, the share price of LVRR developed as follows:\nDate Price per share\n1 December 1910 $ 50\n1 August 1916 $ 40\n27 December 1917 $ 35\n1 March 1920 $ 35\n2 July 1925 $ 40\n3 April 1929 $ 70\n16 October 1930 $ 50\n3 December 1932 $ 12\n3 June 1936 $ 25\n15 June 1939 $ 28\n12 January 1941 $ 30\n72. On selected dates of the above events, the interest rate on 10-year government bonds of\nthe USA developed as follows:\nYear Interest rate\n1916 4,13 %\n1920 5,03 %\n1939 2,29 %\n1941 2,18 %\nThe Dispute\n73. On 1 January 1908, the Protocol to the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation\nbetween the Russian Empire and the USA on the Mutual Encouragement and Protection of\nInvestments (the “Protocol”) entered into force.\n74. On 1 December 1910, Prince Obolensky purchased 80.000 shares of LVRR with a\nnominal value of $ 50 each, thereby acquiring a total of 5 % of LVRR’s stock capital. He\ncontinued to hold these stocks throughout the following decades.\n75. On 1 May 1917, Prince Obolensky sent a letter to the US President, the State Department\nand the Treasury, notifying that he considered the USA’s failure to prevent the July 1916\nexplosion at the Black Tom pier as violation of the Protocol. He stated: “I invite the United\nStates to enter into negotiations regarding the compensation for my losses. Should these\nnegotiations fail, I hereby accept the United States’ offer to arbitrate under the LCIA Rules in\naccordance with the Protocol.”\n\n76. On 31 January 1941, Mr. Obolensky received a letter from the Government of the Soviet\nUnion claiming immediate payment of $ 984,104.62 from Mr. Obolensky as a shareholder of\nLVRR. In this letter, the Soviet Union wrote: “following the judgment of the U.S. District Court\nof New York of 2 July 1925, this amount had been paid to a fraud who purported to represent\nthe State of Russia when, in reality, he was wanted for treason. The Soviet Union has not\nbenefitted from this amount having been paid to the U.S. Treasury against the Russian Empire’s\ndebts because these debts had lost their relevance with the repudiation of debts on 8 February\n1918. The Soviet Union has the right to claim the amount from any shareholder of LVRR against\nwhich the judgment of 2 July 1925 was ordered, particularly you who is guilty of treason for\nhaving opposed the revolution.”\n77. On 30 May 1941, Prince Obolensky filed a Request for Arbitration against the USA\n(Mr. Obolensky and the USA together, the “Parties”) in accordance with Article 1.1, 1.3 of the\nLCIA Arbitration Rules. The Claimant nominated Max Huber as arbitrator. The\nClaimant requested:\nthat the Tribunal to be established under the LCIA Arbitration Rules\nrender an AWARD\nDECLARING that the Respondent breached its obligations under\nArticle 2 (2) Protocol;\nORDERING the Respondent to pay to the Claimant $ 574,806, i.e. 5 %\nof the sum outstanding under the arbitral award of 30 October 1939,\nplus interest at a reasonable commercial rate from 30 October 1939\nonwards until the day that the Award is satisfied; and\nORDERING the Respondent to indemnify the Claimant from any\nclaims raised by the Soviet Union against Claimant in connection with\nthe judgment of the U.S. District Court of New York of 2 July 1925.\n78. In the Request for Arbitration, the Claimant offered as evidence on the responsibility\nfor the Black Tom Explosion, inter alia, the Herrmann Message and the statements by Paul\nHilken recorded in the MCC’s case records. By contrast, the Claimant stated that it was unable\nto receive Mr. Hilken’s testimony as a witness in this arbitration. In addition, the Claimant\nemphasized that in light of its limited financial means it would not submit an expert report by\nan independent forensic valuation expert. Instead, the Claimant insists that the quantitative\ndeterminations of the MCC be applied.\n\n79. On 25 June 1941, the USA filed its Response to the Request for Arbitration in\naccordance with Article 2.1, 2.3 of the LCIA Arbitration Rules. The USA nominated\nChristopher Garnett as arbitrator. In addition, the USA raised the following\npreliminary objections:\ni. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction ratione personae under the\nProtocol. The Claimant is a U.S. national.\nii. Claimant’s claim is an abuse of process. Claimant’s alleged\nsubsidiary has received a final and binding award against Germany in\nthe MCC proceedings. Claimant does not have a right to seek a second\naward – 25 years after the Black Tom Explosion – rather than trying to\nenforce the first award against Germany.\niii. Under the applicable international law on diplomatic protection,\nClaimant’s alleged claim must furthermore be precluded because the\nUSA was asked to provide and did provide diplomatic protection in\nrepresenting LVRR against Germany before the MCC regarding the\nidentical facts now invoked again by LVRR’s shareholder.\niv. The explosion at the Black Tom pier was a sovereign act of the\nGerman military as confirmed in the MCC’s award of 15 June 1939 on\nwhich Claimant itself appears to rely for the determination of its\nfinancial losses. Article 2 (2) Protocol does not protect from foreign\nmilitary acts during times of war.\nv. Mr. Hilken’s statements made in the MCC proceedings and the\nHerrmann Message must be excluded from the record of the present\narbitration. Following the MCC’s final award in 1939, doubts were\nraised about the truthfulness of Mr. Hilken’s statements. The USA are\nnot in a position to disclose more because this matter concerns sensitive\ninformation from its intelligence services. For the present arbitration, it\nis decisive that only statements of witnesses who testify before the\nTribunal are admissive. Mr. Hilken, however, is unwilling to testify as\nhe confirmed towards representatives of the USA. Since his\nunwillingness is not based on a valid reason (such as serious health\nissues), his statements cannot be relied on by the Tribunal. With his\nstatements struck from the record, the authenticity of the Herrmann\nMessage is not established.\nvi. Claimant’s claim must be dismissed in full because of Claimant’s\nrefusal to submit a damages valuation by an independent forensic\nvaluation expert. The determination of LVRR’s losses by the MCC\ncannot be binding on the present Tribunal. This determination was\nmade in a different arbitration, on a different legal basis, and between\ndifferent parties. In investment arbitration, claimants cannot escape\ntheir burden of proof by referring to alleged financial difficulties.\nvii. The sum of which Claimant claims 5 % before this Tribunal equals\nthe interest awarded by the MCC. If the Tribunal were to hold\nRespondent liable under the Protocol (quod non), the interest would\nhave to be significantly lower because Respondent would only have to\npay the rate of its own ten-year government bonds as of today.\nviii. Claimant has no legal basis for its alleged claim that Respondent\nshould indemnify against alleged claims of the Soviet Union. This\nindemnification claim goes beyond Article 2 (2) Protocol and the limits\nof established principles of causation. Even if arguendo the Tribunal\nholds otherwise, the judgment was paid to the correct recipient. Alleged\nclaims of the Soviet Union against their citizens are of no concerns for\nthe USA’s obligations under the Protocol.\n\n80. On 18 July 1941, the LCIA appointed Sir John Fischer Williams, a national of the United\nKingdom, as presiding arbitrator pursuant to Art. 5.6, 5.8 of the LCIA Arbitration Rules. The\nTribunal was constituted. None of the Members of the Tribunal made any disclosure.\n81. On 11 August 1941, Claimant delivered to the Arbitral Tribunal and Respondent his\nwritten election to have his request treated as his Statement of Case pursuant to Art. 15.2 of the\nLCIA Arbitration Rules.\n82. On 3 September 1941, Respondent delivered to the Arbitral Tribunal and Claimant its\nwritten election to have its response treated as its Statement of Defence pursuant to Art. 15.3 of\nthe LCIA Arbitration Rules.\n83. On 23 September 1941, Claimant delivered to the Arbitral Tribunal and Respondent a\nwritten Statement of Reply pursuant to Art. 15.4 of the LCIA Arbitration Rules. Claimant stated\nas follows:\ni. Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction ratione personae is unfounded.\nIt is undisputed that Claimant was a Russian national when the consent\nto arbitrate was perfected. This is the decisive point in time for\njurisdiction. Even if the Tribunal holds otherwise (quod non), under the\napplicable principles of international law, it cannot be held against\nClaimant that he was de-naturalized by the Soviet Union in violation of\ninternational law. He acquired the U.S. nationality only to avoid being\nstateless. Claimant still considers himself Russian.\nii. Claimant’s claim is the opposite of an abuse of process. First, until\n1941, Claimant had been waiting in good faith for the USA to resolve\nthe situation through representing LVRR adequately before the MCC\nand assisting with enforcement. The USA has not fulfilled this mandate\nadequately. Second, as a mere 5 % foreign shareholder, Claimant has\nlimited influence over LVRR’s decision-making. Third, given the\ncurrently ongoing World War II, Claimant cannot be referred to chasing\nGerman assets abroad. For these reasons, Claimant chose to bring this\nclaim under the BIT. This claim is Claimant’s self-standing right.\niii. Under international law, LVRR’s choice to bring the claim before\nthe MCC cannot preclude Claimant’s rights under the BIT. First, the\nmeasure invoked in violation of the BIT is the USA’s failure to prevent\nthe July 1916 explosion, not the USA’s failure to afford diplomatic\nprotection properly (which the USA has not). Second, the rights under\nthe BIT are Claimant’s rights, not LVRR’s rights. Third, LVRR’s\nchoice to bring the Claim before the MCC did not require Claimant’s\nconsent because Claimant owns only 5 %.\niv. Contrary to Respondent, Article 2 (2) BIT entails an obligation of\nthe host State to protect investors from foreign acts of war. That the BIT\napplies in times of war is already evident from Article 9 (1) BIT which\napplies in addition to, not instead of Article 2 (2) BIT.\n\nv. Respondent’s allegations against the Herrmann Message must be\nrejected. First of all, it is remarkable that Respondent is implying that it\nadduced false testimony from Mr. Hilken, used it actively before the\nMCC, but should be able to evade this evidence before the present\nTribunal. Furthermore, Claimant did not submit a witness statement of\nMr. Hilken but documentary records. In international arbitration,\ndocuments need not be submitted through a witness statement. Finally,\nRespondent itself has the authority to order Mr. Hilken (who continues\nto live in the USA) to testify. Respondent cannot benefit from its own\nunwillingness to do so.\nvi. The determination of LVRR’s losses by the MCC should be binding\nor, to the least, persuasive to the Tribunal. The determinative factor is\nwhether the Respondent in the present case (the USA) had an adequate\nopportunity to influenc"}, {"id": "protocol_1908", "title": "Protocol to Treaty of Friendship (1908)", "content": "Protocol on the Mutual Encouragement and Protection \nof Investment  \nProtocol to the Treaty on Friendship, Navigation and Commerce between the Russian Empire \nand the United States of America \n \nThe Russian Empire  \nand  \nThe United States of America,  \nhereinafter referred to as the Contracting Parties, \nDesiring to strengthen their traditional ties of friendship and to extend and intensify the \neconomic relations between them, particularly with respect to investments by the nationals of \none Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, \nRecognising that treaty upon the treatment to be accorded to such investments will stimulate \nthe flow of capital and technology and the economic development of the Contracting Parties \nand the cooperation on navigation issues, \nHave agreed as follows:\n\n2 \nArticle 1  \nFor the purposes of this Agreement: \n(1) the term “investments” means every kind of asset and more particularly, though not \nexclusively: \n(a)    movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem in respect of \nevery kind of asset; \n(b)    rights derived from shares, bonds and other kinds of interests in companies and \njoint ventures; \n(c)   claims to money, to other assets or to any performance having an economic value; \n(d)    rights granted under public law or under contract, including rights to prospect, \nexplore, extract and win natural resources. \n(2)    the term “nationals” shall comprise with regard to either Contracting Party: \n(a)    natural persons having the nationality of that Contracting Party; \n(b)    legal persons constituted under the law of that Contracting Party; \n(c)    legal persons not constituted under the law of that Contracting Party but controlled, \ndirectly or indirectly, by natural persons as defined in (a) or by legal persons as defined \nin (b). \nArticle 2 \n(1) Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable conditions for investors of \nthe other Contracting Party to make investments in its territory and shall admit such \ninvestments, in accordance with its laws and regulations. \n(2) Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection and security \nin the territory of the other Contracting Party. \nArticle 3 \nEach Contracting Party shall accord to investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party \ntreatment which in any case shall not be less favourable than that accorded either to investments \nof its own nationals or to investments of nationals of any third State, whichever is more \nfavourable to the national concerned. \nArticle 4\n\n3 \nIf the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law \nexisting at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the \npresent Agreement contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by \nnationals of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by \nthe present Agreement, such regulation shall, to the extent that it is more favourable, prevail \nover the present Agreement. \nArticle 5 \nEach Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to \ninvestments of nationals of the other Contracting Party. \nArticle 6 \nWith respect to taxes, fees, charges and to fiscal deductions and exemptions, each Contracting \nParty shall accord to nationals of the other Contracting Party who are engaged in any economic \nactivity in its territory, treatment not less favourable than that accorded to its own nationals or \nto those of any third State who are in the same circumstances, whichever is more favourable to \nthe nationals concerned.

Reference is made to Administrative \nDecision No. I for the definition of terms used herein. \nFunctions of Commission. This Commission was established and exists in \npursuance of the terms of the Agreement between the United States and \nGermany dated August 10, 1922. Here are found the source of, and limitations \nupon, the Commission's powers and jurisdiction in the discharge of its task \nof determining the amount to be paid by Germany in satisfaction of her \nfinancial obligations to the United States and to American nationals under \nthe Treaty of Berlin. Article I of the Agreement provides that: \n\"The commission shall pass upon the following categories of claims which \nare more particularly defined in the Treaty of August 25, 192 l. and in the \nTreaty of Versailles: \n\"(l) Claims of American citizens, arising since July 31, 1914, in respect of \ndamage to, or seizure of, their property, rights and interests, including any \ncompany or association in which they are interested, within German territory \nas it existed on August l, 1914; \n\"(2) Other claims for loss or damage to which the United States or its \nnationals have been subjected with respect to injuries to persons, or to property, \nrights and interests, including any company or association in which American \nnationals are interested, since July 31, 1914, as a consequence of the war; \n\"(3) Debts owing to American citizens by the German Government or by \nGerman nationals.'' \nThe financial obligations of Germany which this Commission is empowered \nto determine arise out of claims presented by the United States falling within \nthe several categories specified in the Agreement and more particularly defined \nor described in the Treaty of Berlin. For this more particular definition as \napplied to claims (other than excepted claims) against Germany asserted by \nthe United States on behalf of its nationals reference is made to the decision \nof the Umpire as embraced in the Commission's Administrative Decision No. I.\n\n3\nThe Commission is not concerned with the Treaty of \\'ersailles as such, \nbut only with those of its proviƠions which have been incorporated by reference \ninto the Treaty of Berlin. While for convenient designation reference will be \nmade herein to the Treaty of Versailles, it will be understood (unless the \ncontext plainly indicates the contrary) that such reference is to such of the pre­\nvisions of the Treaty of Versailles as constitute a part of the Treaty of Berlin. \nThe machinery provided by the Treaty of Versailles and the rules and \nmethods of procedure thereunder governing the disposition of claims may be \napplied by but are not binding on this Commission. \nIt does not, of course, follow that every ''claim\" presented to the Commission \nconstitutes a \"financial obligation\" of Gem1any. The American Agent pursues \nthe policy of giving American nationals the benefit of every doubt and presents \nall claims that are not frivolous. Therefore at the threshold of the consideration \nof each claim is presented the question of jurisdiction, which obviously the \nCommission must determine preliminarily to fixing the amount of Germany's \nfinancial obligations, if any. in each case. 1\n\\Vhen the allegations in a petition or memorial presented by the United \nStates bring a claim within the terms of the Treaty, the jurisdiction of the \nCommission attaches. If these allegations are controverted in whole or in \npart by Germany, the issue thus made must be decided by the Commission. \nShould the Commission so decide such issue that the claim does not fall within \nthe terms of the Treaty. it will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. But if \nsuch issue be so decided that the claim does fall within the terms of the Treaty, \nthen the Commission will prescribe the measure of damages, apply such \nmeasure to the facts in the particular case as the Commission may find them, \nand fix the financial obligation of Germany therein. The Commission's task is \nto apply the terms of the Treaty of Berlin to each case presented, decide those \nwhich it holds are within its jurisdiction, and dismiss all others. \nThe Commission is not concerned with the payment by Germany of its \nfinancial obligations arising under the Treaty. Its task is confined solely to \nfixing the amount of such financial obligations. \nPrinciples governing Commission. In its adjudications the Commission will be \ncontrolled by the termơ of the Treaty of Berlin. \\Vhere no applicable provision \nis found in that instrument, in determining the me;:,sure of damages the \nCommission may apply: 2 \n1 \"History and Digest of the International Arbitrations to which the United\nStates Has Been a Party,\" by John Bassett Moore, 1898 (hereinafter cited as \"Moore's \nArbitrations\"): Volume I, pages 324-'.127, Volume III, Chapter LII, pages 2277-\n2312, and page 2599; \"International Law Chiefly as Interpreted and Applied by \nthe United States,\" by Charles Cheney Hyde, 1922 (hereinafter cited as \"Hyde\") \nsection 577 (Volume II, page 153) and authorities cited in notes; \"Papers Relating \nto the Foreign Relations of the United States,\" 1895, Part I, pages 83-84, letter \nfrom l\\1r.

In order to bring a claim ( other \nthan a Government claim) within the jurisdiction of this Commission, the \nloss must have been suffered by an American national, and the claim for such \nloss must have since continued in American ownership.Ƙ \nThe enquiry is: Was the United States, which is the claimant, injured \nthrough injury to its national? It was not so injured where the injured person \nwas at the time of suffering the injury a citizen of another state. While natura­\nlization transfers allegiance, it does not carry with it existing state obligations. \nAny other rule would convert a nation into a claim agent in behalf of those \navailing of its naturalization laws to become its citizens after suffering injury. 5 \n(Footnote cnn./mued [rum page 25.) \nGrotius, Whewell translation, 1853 (hereinafter cited as \"Grotim\"), Book III, \nChapter XX, sections 46-48; Hyde, section 559; II Moore's Arbitrations, page 1226; \n\"Venezuelan Arbitrations of 1903,\" report by Jackson H.

Umpire, in the Orinoco Steamship Company Case, Venezuelan \nArbitrations 1903, at pages 84-85. \nThe rule here laid down will not preclude the presentation by the American \nAgent and the consideration by this Commission of the claims, if any, of citizens \nof the Virgin Islands and others similarly situated, who, after suffering damages \nthrough the act of Germany or her agents, became American nationals through the \nacquisition of territory by the United States and not on their own initiative. \n4\n\nApportionment of awards amongst claimants. As above stated, 1t 1s the province \nof this Commission to adjudicate claims presented by the United States, on \nits own behalf and on behalf of its nationals, against Germany falling within \nthe several categories defined or described in the Treaty of Berlin. \nThe primary purpose of such adjudication is to determine the amount of \nGermany's financial obligations to the United States under the Treaty. 6 \nObviously, Germany is concerned only with the amount of her obligations \nand not with any distribution which may be made by the United States of \nsuch amount when paid. But both Governments are directly interested in, \nand this Commission in passing upon its jurisdiction must determine, the \nownership of each claim at and since its inception. \nIn that class of claims where two or more are joined as claimants in one \ncase because their respective causes of action are based upon a single occur­\nrence, and where their demands are several rather than joint, this Commission \nmust, after disposing of all jurisdictional questions, determine how much each \nclaimant is entitled to recover before the aggregate amount of the award in \nthat case can be fixed. \nTo illustrate: Claims growing out of injuries resulting in death are not \nasserted on behalf of the estate of I he deceased, the award to be distributed \naccording to the provisions of a will or any other fixed or arbitrary basis. The \nright to recover rests on the direct personal loss, if any, suffered by each of the \nclaimants. All issues with respect to parties entitled to recover, as well as \nissues involving the measure of damages, are determined, not by the law of \nthe domicile of the deceased, but in private or municipal jurisprudence by the \nlaw of the place where the tort was committed 7-here by the law of nations \nand the application of the governing principles above announced. The rules \nfor measuring the damages suffered by each claimant are the same. But those \nrules must be separately applied to the circumstances and conditions, not only \nof the deceased but of each claimant as well, to arrive at the quantum of damages \nsuffered by each claimant. This process necessarily involves a determination \nof the amount to be awarded each claimant rather than the aggregate amount \nof Germany's liability for the loss of a life. The problem in such cases is, not to \ndistribute a given amount assessed against Germany amongst several persons, \nbut to assess separately the damages suffered by each of such persons who \njointly present independent claims. This the Commission will do. \nIn so doing we are mindful of expressions used in the opinions of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States to the effect that one claiming an award made by \nan international tribunal in favor of another is bound by the decision of such \ntribunal as to the validity of the claim and the amount of the award but ,wt \nas to the ownership the,eof 8 \n' See Preamble to Agreement; Frelinghuysen v.

The first relates to the fire which occurred on the night of July 29-30, 1916, at the terminal yard of the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company in New York harbor, known as the Black Tom Terminal, and is known as the Black Tom Case. The second relates to the destruction of the Kingsland plant of the Agency of Canadian Car and Foundry Company, Limited, at Kingsland, New Jersey, and is known as the Kingsland Case. This fire started in the late afternoon of January 11, 1917. The two cases have from the beginning been carried along together, both in the taking of the evidence and in the arguments. It will be convenient to deal with them in one opinion.\n\n[2] The questions involved are questions of fact. Germany and the United States, now friendly nations, have entered into an agreement under which Germany accepts liability for such damage during neutrality to citizens of the United States, if the damage resulted from acts of her authorized agents.\n\n[3] The Commission has no difficulty with the question of authority in these cases. The persons alleged to be responsible for causing these two fires to be set — either by participating in the act themselves or by employing sub-agents of their own — were in such relation to the German authorities, and some of them in such special relation to Nadolny and Marguerre, who were in charge of the Political Section of the German General Staff, or to Hinsch, that Germany must be held responsible if they, or some of them, did cause the fires to be set. The Commission does not need direct proof, but on the evidence as submitted we could hold Germany responsible if, but only if, we are reasonably convinced that the fires occurred in some way through the acts of certain German agents.\n\n[4] We have no doubt that authority was so given by Marguerre in February, 1916. Marguerre himself so testifies. Nadolny had on January 26, 1915, sent a cable authorizing such sabotage. Nadolny in his evidence gives the impression that the policy was abandoned shortly after his cable. Marguerre testifies that the authority given by him in 1916 was not to be exercised during neutrality, but only in case the United States entered into the war. We do not believe his evidence with respect to this alleged limitation of the authority, though.\n\n[5] It is well recognized that Governments who have agreed to arbitrate are under obligation in entire good faith to try to ascertain the real truth. Nadolny may have suppressed evidence as to his knowledge of the instructions given by Marguerre, and we think, though of course we may be mistaken, that Marguerre did not tell the truth. Nadolny’s examination was confined wholly to his cable, and the Marguerre instructions were not at that time a feature of the case. We cannot be sure of what Nadolny knew, and would not be willing without further evidence to accuse him, but we have felt it necessary to mention the possibility. It is also apparent that von Strempel of the German Legation in Chile, in another connection, failed to communicate to the Commission statements made to him by Herrmann, which tended strongly to cast doubt upon an affidavit of Herrmann which von Strempel was forwarding to the Commission, though it should be added that we can easily understand that von Strempel did not believe these boasting tales of Herrmann, who even then, apparently, did not admit complicity of himself or Hinsch in Black Tom or Kingsland. Marguerre’s personality does not seem important, but Nadolny and von Strempel are diplomatic representatives of Germany. Von Strempel was a young man, unfamiliar with the case, and probably did not fully realize his obligation as a diplomatic representative to the Commission and to his own Government.\n\n[6] In speaking as we have of Nadolny, Marguerre, and von Strempel we have not the least intention to raise any doubt as to the entire good faith of the present German Government in its management and presentation of these cases, nor of the Agent who has represented Germany as counsel. And in order that this last statement may not be construed as merely conventional courtesy, we state specifically that we have no such doubts. We believe that the present German Government was entirely prepared to bring out the truth and to take the consequences, whatever they might be.\n\n[7] It is unnecessary to go further and determine whether such sabotage was the general policy of the then German Government. The Foreign Office did specifically authorize the cable, already referred to, which Nadolny sent to the Embassy in Washington. We are inclined to think that the diplomatic representatives in the United States were not in accord with the idea and did nothing in the way of exercising this particular authority. There was an admitted policy to destroy and damage property of the nations at war with Germany at this time and later, and it is obvious that such acts if committed in or from the United States were serious violations of neutrality, that agents engaged therein were not likely to discriminate very carefully between acts on United States territory and acts outside the United States, or between property belonging to Germany’s enemies and property not yet delivered, but intended for Germany’s enemies. But in general we are all inclined to the opinion that Germany’s diplomatic representatives in the United States were averse to attacks on American property, that their opposition to such a policy, so far as they, possibly, knew or suspected that it was being carried out, became stronger as the relations between the United States and Germany became more and more acute. We see no evidence in these cases, however, that such authority as the Political Section of the General Staff gave was ever modified. And up to the entry of the United States into the war there were in the United States certain German agents who were, or at least pretended to be, active in sabotage work. But we are also convinced that the number of agents so engaged was always small in proportion to the field to be covered, that they were never organized effectively, and that their numbers and effectiveness continually decreased, partly because of difficulty of communicating with Germany and other difficulties inherent in their situation and even more\n\n[8] because of efficient counter-work by the United States Secret Service and prosecuting officers. We are convinced also that their pretensions in such reports as they may have made and in their talk with each other were for the most part gross exaggerations of their actual accomplishments.\n\n[9] With this background, which renders inferences against Germany easier than they would otherwise be, we approach the evidence as to the German agents and their alleged tools. We found ourselves absolutely in agreement as to this background upon our first consultation after the close of the arguments and before we had considered at all the responsibility of any of the German agents.\n\n[10] These cases have been argued twice, the second argument having been necessitated by the production of new evidence. The second argument has occupied the most of ten days, and it has not been too long in view of the enormous record of evidence and the details which the counsel were obliged to cover. We have no intention of covering all these details in our opinion, but it seems desirable that we should indicate as briefly as possible our views as to some of the more prominent features of the evidence, although we will begin by stating our final conclusions, viz.:\n\n[11] In the Kingsland Case we find upon the evidence that the fire was not caused by any German agent.\n\n[12] In the Black Tom case we are not convinced that the fire was not attributable to Hinsch and Kristoff, though we are convinced that it was not attributable to Witzke or Jahnke. But we are quite a long way from being convinced that the fire was caused by any German agent.\n\n[13] We therefore decide both cases in favor of Germany.\n\n[14] In the Kingsland Case the persons possibly involved as participants are Witzke, Jahnke, Hinsch, Herrmann, Wozniak, Rodriguez, and Thorne. The evidence relating to Witzke and Jahnke is mainly in the shape of alleged admissions by Witzke and is intermingled with his alleged admissions in connection with the Black Tom Case. This evidence makes no impresson whatever upon us with respect to the Kingsland Case, but the fact that it does refer to the Kingsland fire as well as to the Black Tom fire tends to weaken the effect of the alleged admissions as to the Black Tom Case. On the evidence we are satisfied that Witzke and Jahnke were not in the east at the time of the Kingsland fire, and eliminate them from further consideration in connection with Kingsland.\n\n[15] The Kingsland fire of January 11, 1917, started in a building devoted to the cleaning of shells. It started at the bench of a workman named Wozniak. The case against Germany in substance depends upon whether Wozniak started this fire, under Herrmann’s direction.\n\n[16] Until Herrmann who was undoubtedly a German agent and had previously testified that he had nothing whatever to do with the Kingsland fire, changed his attitude and testified that he employed Wozniak to start the fire there was nothing from which we could reasonably infer either that Wozniak was a German agent or that he caused the fire. Hilken another German agent, since Herrmann changed his testimony, has testified that Herrmann told him long ago the same story that Herrmann now tells. Hinsch, the man whom Herrmann connects with himself in the story, has denied it. His denial contains plausible details, but we could not rely on it if we felt that Herrmann was now telling the truth, for though we have no evidence that Hinsch is a liar, there is a strong presumption that he might be under circumstances which pointed to his guilt.\n\n[17] Hilken and Herrmann are both liars, not presumptive but proven. No one could in the light of all their evidence believe anything either says unless\n\n[18] something other than his own assertion confirmed his statements. Hilken’s first long and detailed statement in these cases contained nothing of what he now says in respect to Kingsland. He had previously testified before the Alien Property Custodian and had lied continuously. In his first statement for the Commission he professes his willingness to tell the entire truth. If he did, there can be no truth either in his or Herrmann’s present story. Later he admits that he did not earlier tell the whole truth, and explains his failure to do so by his unwillingness to implicate others. But after this first testimony to the Commission he was sent by counsel for the claimants to Chile to persuade Herrmann to testify, in which mission he failed. On his return he made an affidavit covering his conversations in Chile with Herrmann. In this affidavit it is evident that he had no further desire to shield Herrmann, if he ever really had such a desire. He tells of various things which Herrmann said to him which he knew were not true, and pretends to tell what he knows to the contrary. But he says nothing about his knowledge of the story Herrmann now tells about Kingsland. If Hilken had not mentioned Kingsland in this affidavit, his present story would be more credible. But he says that he asked Herrmann about Kingsland and that Herrmann in Chile denied all knowledge of it. Instead of reporting that Herrmann had previously told him all about it, as he now testifies, he adds to Herrmann’s denial merely the statement that Herrmann had previously told him that he and one Gerdts once rode over to look at Kingsland after the fire.\n\n[19] Herrmann’s present story has in its favor whatever presumption arises, even after repeated denials, from the fact that he is confessing his own participation in a crime of serious importance. We know also that some of the things he previously denied are true. We know, or at least believe, that he was authorized in Berlin by Marguerre to commit sabotage during neutrality, and we know that he was supplied by Marguerre with inflammatory devices in the form of pencils, containing glass tubes. Appropriately manipulated the chemicals in the tubes would mix after an interval of from 15 to 30 minutes and cause a flame. But his testimony now with respect to Kingsland and Black Tom is not at all that of a witness who for reasons of conscience desires to make a clean breast. Whether he now means to tell the truth or means to lie, he is testifying solely because of the fact that he has lost his position in Chile, that the German Government has not taken care of him, and that by testifying he has secured the chance to get back to the United States with a guaranty of immunity. We do not imply or think that anything improper was done to induce him to testify, merely that it is sufficiently obvious that Herrmann would not have turned his coat if the German Government or the German Legation in Chile had offered him appropriate inducements, and that having turned his coat because of advantage to himself he is pretty sure to be in a mental attitude in which hostility to Germany and desire to make good with the claimants play a substantial part. And there is nothing about Herrmann of which we feel so sure as that he will lie if he thinks lying worth-while from his own point of view.\n\n[20] His story is, in brief, that he planned in accordance with instructions from Nadolny and Marguerre to commit sabotage in Kingsland, that he applied to Hinsch to furnish a man, that Hinsch said he would and brought Wozniak to him, that he learned from Wozniak, not from Hinsch that Wozniak was working in the Kingsland plant and that Wozniak thought he could accomplish something, that after one or two interviews he got distrustful of Wozniak, who seemed to him like a \"nut\", told Hinsch so and asked him for another man. Hinsch then brought Rodriguez to him. Herrmann then brought Wozniak and Rodriguez together and asked Wozniak if he could get Rodriguez a job\n\n[21] at Kingsland. Wozniak said he could as he had a pull with the employment bureau. Still later he met the two and learned that Rodríguez had the job. He then gave them each some of the inflammatory pencils, told them how to fix them up, and instructed them to put one in a coat pocket somewhere, standing up straight. The chemicals would do the rest. He paid them not over 5540 a week — he did not seem very sure how much — during this short period. After the fire he saw Rodríguez once, but he never saw Wozniak again. He asked no questions whatever of Rodríguez, but paid him $500. gave him a fictitious address and never saw him again.\n\n[22] Herrmann’s story is somewhat confirmed by the fact that probably Rodríguez was employed about the time Herrmann says, shortly before the fire, and by the fact that Wozniak has peculiarities which might lead Herrmann to characterize him as a \"nut\", though the word \"crank\" would really be more accurate. On the other hand, Herrmann before he had told this Wozniak story had seen enough of the early arguments, briefs, and affidavits in the case to know of Wozniak, to suspect him of being a bit queer, to know that the fire started at his bench, to know that Rodríguez was supposed to have usually worked next to Wozniak. But there is nothing to show that Herrmann could have learned beforehand that Rodríguez had been employed only a short time, though this is not impossible. Herrmann’s attention would before his testimony have been focussed somewhat on Rodriguez because in the early stages of the case Herrmann himself was suspected of having been the Rodriguez who worked at the plant. This suspicion was probably due to the fact that Herrmann used the name Rodriguez when he was in Mexico before going to Chile. It is argued that the fact that he used this name is a confirmation of his present story, that the name came into his head because he had employed Rodriguez. But it seems to us unlikely that Herrmann would take in Mexico the name of someone whom he had employed to set the Kingsland plant on fire, and Rodriguez is a common enough name in Spanish countries. In fact there were 20 different men named Rodriguez on the payroll at Kingsland at different times.\n\n[23] Herrmann's story, as stated above, appears at its best, but there are internal difficulties in the story itself. A man named Thorne plays an important part in the theory relating to Wozniak and Rodriguez. Thorne was in the employment office of the Kingsland plant, and the theory is that he was well known to Hinsch, that Hinsch had Wozniak and Rodriguez at his command, and that Rodriguez must have obtained his employment through Thorne. There is a good deal of evidence that throws suspicion of some sort on Thorne, so far as sympathy with Germany, general lack of morals and willingness to do shady things are concerned, but nothing convincing to show Thorne’s acquaintance with Hinsch. Hinsch denies acquaintance with Thorne, but it was certainly possible that he did know him. Herrmann says he did not know Thorne, though there is some evidence that he did. Wozniak had been in the plant six months at least, and so had been there several months when Thorne was employed as an assistant in the employment office. If Hinsch had had Wozniak at his command and in the plant, there was no very good reason why Herrmann should have taken part in the scheme to have Wozniak do the work. If these other allegations are true, Herrmann would not have asked Wozniak where he was working, as he says he did the first time he saw him. He would not have asked Wozniak, as he says he did, if Wozniak could get Rodriguez a job. And Hinsch would not have assented without any discussion, as Herrmann says he did, to Herrmann’s estimate of Wozniak as unsuitable for his purpose. Herrmann’s story of his conversations with Wozniak and Rodriguez is strangely lacking in the details which would be inevitable in such conver-\n\n[24] sations. if he ever employed these men for the purpose and in the way he says he did. He was pressed by German counsel for any further details of these conversations, but we get no talk as to how or where they could set the fire, or whether a fire was likely to be effective if set in Wozniak’s building, no discussion of particulars with either of them except the instructions as to the pencils which were quite explicit. This lack of detail might have been explained by the fact of which we are convinced that Wozniak’s knowledge of either English or German was extremely limited. But Herrmann says that the conversations were in English and that Wozniak spoke English freely though with an accent, a statement which in view of our judgment as to Wozniak’s ability to speak English at that time arouses further distrust.\n\n[25] And the job, according to Herrmann’s story, seems to have been turned over by Herrmann to Rodríguez after he came on the scene. Rodríguez, not Wozniak, was the man relied on. Rodríguez was the only one of the two who turned up after the fire, and Herrmann explicitly says that he asked him no questions at all but paid him $5500 and never saw him again. And yet Wozniak set the fire if anyone did. And Rodríguez, the only man Herrmann saw after the fire, the only man he paid after the fire, was not at the Kingsland plant at all on the day of the fire.\n\n[26] If there is one thing sure about Wozniak, it is that Wozniak was keen for money. That he would not have come after his money himself is inconceivable to us with our knowledge of Wozniak’s previous and contemporary life and habits. We have a great deal of evidence about Wozniak’s earnings and his use of his money, but we get no indication whatever that he actually got any of the money that Herrmann said he paid.\n\n[27] Again, Herrmann’s description of Wozniak corresponds exactly with a poor photograph of him which, we think. Herrmann had seen before he told his story, and differs in two quite important particulars from the real Wozniak. Herrmann’s story of Wozniak’s presence later in Mexico also arouses our suspicion, partly because we are quite certain that Wozniak never was in Mexico, partly because it is improbable that, if he had turned up in Mexico, Herrmann would not have seen him. and partly because, whether Herrmann saw him or not, his talk there in Mexico with Hinsch about Wozniak’s presence in Mexico could not possibly have been so casual and inconsequential as Herrmann states that it was.\n\n[28] The discrepancies and improbabilities of Herrmann’s story tend to strengthen our very strong impression from Wozniak’s acts and statements at the time of the fire and shortly thereafter and from the circumstances of the fire that Wozniak was not guilty. In the same way our impression of Wozniak, derived from careful study of these acts and statements and circumstances, tends to increase our doubt of Herrmann’s sincerity in his latest evidence.\n\n[29] Our impression that Wozniak is innocent is not due to his own protestations of innocence. Any man, however guilty, might claim innocence, and Wozniak has shown in connection with matters having nothing to do with the fire that he would not let a little thing like truth stand in his way.\n\n[30] Our impression is derived first from the circumstances connected with the fire itself. Gasoline was used in cleaning the shells and the fire spread quickly, so that there was great excitement and confusion. The interval between the time when the first small flame was seen and the time when everyone present ran for his life was very short. The pan of gasoline close to Wozniak’s machine (as in the case of all the 48 machines) would account for this, but in addition one workman says that one of the men threw a pail of water on the bench where the flame first appeared. (The fire buckets in the building contained water instead of sand.) Wozniak says he made an effort to stifle the fire, and\n\n[31] there is evidence of another workman that he saw Wozniak make some such effort. If we were called upon to guess what caused the fire from the evidence of the circumstances, we should without hesitation turn to the machine which held the shell which Wozniak was cleaning. There is strongly persuasive evidence that these machines required constant watching, that when out of order they squeaked and threw out sparks, and that fires, quickly extinguished, had previously occurred from this source, and there is some evidence from a workman close by of squeaking and of sparks from Wozniak’s machine just at the time of the starting of the fire. Wozniak himself does not mention this in his contemporaneous statements, though he later mentioned it merely as a possible explanation. In fact he says that his machine was running well that day, though it had sometimes run very hot. To Wozniak the fire seemed to originate in the rapidly revolving shellcase itself and to follow the rag wound around a stick with which he was drying the shellcase when he withdrew the rag. It is interesting to find that his own statement is the only one which bears any resemblance to what would have happened if he had used one of the inflammatory pencils with which Herrmann says he supplied him.\n\n[32] Wozniak, as we have said, is not a \"nut\", but a crank, He is in a way smart, though naive, and thinks he is smarter than he really is. How could such a man, or any man who had for some time been studying and planning how to set fire to the plant, start the fire at his own bench, where attention would necessarily be directed to him, to say nothing of the fact that the particular place and the particular building would not, to persons planning beforehand to set a fire, seem to be places where a fire once started would be particularly likely to be effective, as this fire certainly was? And that a smart crank like Wozniak should after starting the fire with an inflammatory pencil describe its beginning in a way which had even a slight resemblance to a pencil fire is equally incomprehensible. Also incomprehensible is the fact that a man like Wozniak should not have had ready, when he was examined a day or two later, some plausible explanation of the cause of the fire, but he certainly had no explanation at hand, though later he made various suggestions and possibilities.\n\n[33] Although as we have said, Wozniak’s description of the starting of the fire bears some resemblance to what might have happened if a pencil had been used, the resemblance is not close enough to make us suspect that a pencil was actually used. But more important is the fact that Wozniak, if he used a pencil, must have abandoned completely Herrmann’s instructions as to how to use the pencils. The pencil was intended to enable an incendiary to start the fire at a time and place when and where he could not be connected with it. The pencil was devised to operate only after the lapse of from 15 to 30 minutes. It was not at all adapted to starting a fire at the place where the incendiary intended to remain. Besides, the pencil needed to stand upright, and the shell from which Wozniak said the fire seemed to start was in a horizontal position revolving in Wozniak’s machine in the process of cleaning and drying. The shells seem to have passed through the various phases of this process at the rate of about three every two minutes, an average of about 40 seconds each. Even if we assume that Wozniak had found some way — Herrmann evidently had not — to make the pencil work faster, we cannot adapt the pencil idea to the actual process, and cannot imagine that anyone planning the fire in advance would have considered it possible to use the pencil there under the eyes of the other workmen close by. Rodriguez and Wozniak are supposed to be working together on this plot. They are instructed by Herrmann and provided with pencils. They talk and plan together — supposedly — how to do the job. There are toilets available; there are workmen’s coats somewhere; there are even coats hanging about that particular room; there are\n\n[34] cases of clean rags; there are dirty, gasoline-soaked rags; there must be other opportunities of which we have no evidence. And yet we are asked to believe that Wozniak started the fire with a pencil in a dry shellcase, which was revolving in his own machine at the end of this process which as a whole lasted about 40 seconds. And Rodriguez, the man really relied upon, was not there that day.\n\n[35] The evidence as to Wozniak’s conduct at the moment, his examinations, his conduct during the weeks immediately succeeding, his relations with the representatives of Russia, his life before the fire and afterwards almost to the present, his disappearance, his reappearance and his subsequent testimony, his alleged appearance in Mexico among the German agents there, occupy many pages of the record and could be discussed here ad infinitum, as they have properly been discussed almost ad infinitum by counsel in their briefs and arguments. Suffice it to say that we do not believe that he was in Mexico; that the letters he wrote the Russian Embassy before the fire are in our judgment not a blind, but exactly such letters as Wozniak would compose, and indicate to us that he really, as he says, was at heart Russian, intended to go to Russia, and was shocked at the carelessness and, as he thought, corruption of the inspectors at this plant which was assembling shells for Russia; that without relying at all on his honesty of statement he nevertheless seems to us to act and talk like a man who is really innocent in respect to this fire. It is of some significance that through the Russian Consulate he sent $90 to Russia the day after the fire — not the act of a man who the previous day had destroyed this supply plant for Russian munitions, and whose money or part of it came as pay for such destruction. The picture of him which one gets from reading the reports of the four detectives who watched him night and day for about four weeks following the fire is a picture of a man frugal in the extreme, living at the Russian Immigrants’ Home, buying and cooking his own meals, milk, bread, occasionally a little fish or meat or fruit, reading Russian papers or books a good deal, quiet, with no luxuries or dissipations, almost no acquaintances, no suspicious actions, no suspicious meetings, no indication whatever that he had anything to do with his supposed co-conspirator Rodriguez or anybody connected with Germany.\n\n[36] And so, despite Herrmann’s confession, the evidence in the Kingsland Case has convinced us that Wozniak did not set the Kingsland fire, and that Germany cannot be held responsible for it.\n\n[37] In connection with Black Tom we shall not mention some possibilities which have practically been abandoned by the claimants, or some agents who have not been abandoned in argument, like Sauerbeck for instance. We have not ignored them but we do not think them worth talking about in connection with Black Tom.\n\n[38] The picture of the fire itself, which we have in our minds as the result of our study of the voluminous, detailed, and often contradictory evidence, shows a large railroad terminal on the Black Tom promontory which stretches out from the Jersey side into New York harbor not far from Ellis Island. This terminal is full of railroad cars, many of them loaded with ammunition. At one point is a dock to which on that night were tied up a number of barges, some of which, like the cars, were loaded with shells and TNT. The yard was guarded and watched, but access to it by intentional incendiaries, particularly from the New York harbor, was certainly not impossible, perhaps not difficult. The fire started in the middle of a clear, fairly calm night at about 12:45 a.m., in the form of a small blaze which was discovered by the watchmen, breaking out around the door of a wooden boxcar which probably contained explosive shells filled with smokeless powder. There is some claim of more than one\n\n[39] fire, but we do not believe there was. The fire spread, the explosions occurred, and the damage was great. It is somewhat difficult to understand how incendiaries under the circumstances as we picture them could have secured access to this car, broken into it, and set the fire without being seen or heard. Nor does it seem likely that careful planning beforehand would have resulted in setting fire at this part of the yard, or in one car, or in this particular car. There were other points of approach and other methods which in advance would have seemed more likely to produce results. But there is nothing in the circumstances which excludes incendiarism. The fact that smokeless powder, properly prepared, is conceded by experts not to be subject to spontaneous combustion is a strong argument in favor of incendiarism. But the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company in its defense to the suits brought against it for negligence relied largely upon spontaneous combustion, and we get the impression that their counsel had real faith in this particular defense. And yet they then had in their possession a good deal of the evidence which we now have which tends to implicate Kristoff.\n\n[40] So far as we can see, the circumstances of the fire leave the question of its cause open. It may have been some fault in the preparation of the powder in the shells in this car; it may have come from some other cause connected with explosives, for though we know of no cause which would naturally be suggested by the supposed contents of this car we are suspicious of explosives in general; it may have come from some other accident of which no evidence appears; of course the fire may have been of incendiary origin, and in this connection it may be noted that all incendiaries are not German agents. We can be sure, however, that any German agent seeking for a chance to destroy munitions would have looked upon Black Tom with the keenest interest.\n\n[41] Leaving out of account some alleged suspects who are not worth attention, there are two theories which attribute the fire to German agents. One of these theories centers about Witzke and Jahnke; the other around Kristoff. Both theories have been urged upon us strongly. The two theories may be combined into one theory, viz., that all three took part. The two theories never have been, in fact, so definitely separated in the arguments or in the evidence as our statement above would imply. But we insist upon the separation. We are sure that if Witzke and Jahnke were concerned in Black Tom no person like Kristoff would have been needed or used. He would have been not only a superfluity but a nuisance, even a menace. Witzke and Jahnke strike us as capable, capable where German interests were involved of desperate measures not in the least in need of assistance from an individual like Kristoff. We do not believe that they would even have trusted Kristoff to row a boat, much less to take a real part in any Black Tom expedition.\n\n[42] Witzke took part in an expedition from Mexico into Arizona after the United States entered the war. He was betrayed by his companion, Altendorf. who was in the employ of the United States as well of the Germans, convicted as a spy by court-martial, sentenced to death. He was a spy and the sentence was appropriate, but it was later commuted to life imprisonment and still later he was released. The evidence of participation in Black Tom by Witzke and Jahnke consists chiefly of admissions alleged to have been made by Witzke to his companion Altendorf before he was captured, with some confirmation by another companion, Gleaves, and by others including one or two guards who talked to him during his confinement. The alleged admissions cover not only Black Tom but also Kingsland. Witzke has consistently denied these admissions during his trial and confinement and since his release. As we have so definite an impression about Kingsland, the inclusion of Kingsland in his supposed admissions would of itself make it almost impossible for us to accept the admis-\n\n[43] sion so far as concerns Black Tom. Altendorf, the chief witness as to admissions by Witzke, is also the chief liar who has appeared in the cases before us, a chief among competitors of no mean qualifications. The details, so far as any details appear in the supposed admissions, have little relation to probability, even if we assume that Witzke and Jahnke were actually involved in Black Tom. It is perhaps unnecessary to add anything to the above, but we are also satisfied from the evidence that Witzke and Jahnke were not in the east at the time of the Black Tom fire.\n\n[44] The only effect which all the evidence and argument with respect to Witzke and Jahnke has had upon us is to add considerably to the doubts which we would in any event have had with respect to the evidence implicating Kristoff. Kristoff never set the Black Tom fire alone. Witzke and Jahnke being eliminated, there are no persons in the evidence who seem at all likely to have been his companions, a fact which is nowhere near conclusive but which adds to our doubts. And the actual evidence against Kristoff is so nearly of the same nature as these categorical admissions attributed to Witzke that when we find ourselves satisfied that Witzke’s alleged admissions mean nothing to us our doubts as to analogous admissions and other analogous testimony are strengthened.\n\n[45] Suspicion was focussed very early on Kristoff in connection with Black Tom. He lived at the time at Bayonne, N. J, with an aunt, Mrs. Rushnak, whose daughter was Mrs. Chapman at whose house Kristoff had sometimes roomed earlier. A day or two after Black Tom Mrs. Chapman reported to Lieutenant Rigney, a police officer of Bayonne whom she knew well, that Kristoff had reached home on the night of the fire at about four o’clock in the morning, that he was greatly excited, and that her mother heard him walking in his room and heard him say \"What I do! What I do!\" and that they suspected him of being responsible for the Black Tom fire. We feel sure that this is all they reported. Both Rigney and Charlock, a detective who was assigned to the case and followed it assiduously, say so, and we take pleasure in adding that we believe them. We also believe what Mrs. Chapman then reported to Rigney, and we believe that the two women really suspected Kristoff. Later Mrs. Chapman said that she at some earlier time saw something like a blueprint or blueprints in Kristoff’s room, when he was in her house, and that in his absence she once read a letter, which he had written but had not yet sent, to a man named Grandson or Grandor, demanding a large sum of money. We do not believe that Kristoff had a blueprint, certainly not for his own use, for we do not believe that he could use one. His own story about Graentsor makes it possible that he wrote a letter such as Mrs. Chapman described, but we doubt any story told by her after Kristoff’s own story to the police came to her knowledge. The value of any evidence by Mrs. Rushnak and Mrs. Chapman, except as to Kristoff’s late arrival, his excitement, and the \"What I do!\", will appear from their later statements. Mrs. Chapman said later that Kristoff was in the habit of going away on trips and that wherever he went there was always an explosion, and they both said later, some ten years or more later, that Kristoff told Mrs. Rushnak the morning after the fire that he had set the fire. We feel quite sure that they really suspected Kristoff in spite of the fact that Mrs. Chapman’s husband later told Green in Charlock’s presence that his wife had reported the matter to Rigney merely because she was in a family way and thought she might get some money from the Lehigh Valley Railroad. As to the reasonableness of their then suspicion, we can judge only by our own guess from the late arrival, the excitement, and the \"What I do\". Mrs. Chapman’s and Mrs. Rushnak’s judgments on a given state of facts are worthless. At this stage of the evidence we can only add that Kristoff was a man who\n\n[46] probably returned late at night at other times, that excitement whether for a good reason or for a trivial reason was probably not an unusual event for Kristoff, and that if he was excited it is unlikely that he expressed his excitement in the English language. The \"What I do! What I do!\" is probably Mrs. Rushnak's translation of what she heard Kristoff say. But at the same time it is hardly likely that it is not a substantially correct translation.\n\n[47] The name Grantnor is of great significance in this case. The connection between Kristoff and Hinsch, who was a German agent and who is alleged to have used Kristoff as his tool in Black Tom, depends substantially on whether Hinsch used the name Grantnor as an alias. One Frank Oscar Granson seems to have been actually an individual who later was a witness in the Rintelen case, whom Hinsch is supposed to have known. The theory pressed upon us is that Hinsch in seeking aliases was accustomed to adopt names familiar to him and so adopted Granson. Why he should have changed it to Grantnor, or Graentnor, as it is more commonly spelled in the evidence, and why he should have changed Frank to Francis, is not explained. The actual spelling is of importance, for Grantnor is an English name and Graentnor is not, and Grantnor and Graentnor are pronounced differently. The significance of the spelling applies particularly to Herrmann’s evidence, for Herrmann was obviously in doubt as to the spelling. Herrmann to corroborate his testimony that Hinsch used the name Grantnor says that he laughed at Hinsch for using the name because it was an English name and Hinsch, as was obvious to anyone, was a German. There is no sense in this testimony of Herrmann if the name was spelled Graentnor or if Herrmann thought it might have been so spelled. Herrmann, though born in the United States, was a thorough German — knew the German language thoroughly. He could not have called Graentnor an English name, and he could not have imagined that a name, which he had heard often pronounced and was accustomed himself to pronounce Grantnor. might possibly be spelled Graentnor.\n\n[48] The name, whatever it is, appeared first in Kristoff’s story to the police on his arrest in 1916. We have a verbatim report of one of these examinations. As Kristoff first used the name here, it is spelled Graentsor. In the other places in this report it appears as Graentor and many times. How it was then pronounced we do not know. In the police examination of Kristoff later in 1921, the name appears as Gramshaw, indicating that Kristoff when using the name himself always insisted on the \"s\". Kristoff does not seem to have raised any question in his first police examination as to the dropping of the \"s\" by his examiners, or as to the pronunciation, whatever it may have been. But Kristoff was not the kind of man to worry about such changes so long as he understood what man they were asking him about. And Kristoff was not the kind of man to invent the name, whatever the name was. He must have known some man who called himself either Grantsor, Grantnor, Graentnor. Grandor, or perhaps Gramshaw.\n\n[49] Rigney and Charlock were of the Bayonne police force. As Black Tom was in the jurisdiction of the Jersey City police, Rigney reported Mrs. Chapman’s story to them. At their request Rigney arrested Kristoff about 30 days after the fire and turned him over to the Jersey City police. The case was in charge of one Green, now dead, but Charlock kept in close touch with it. Kristoff was committed as a suspicious person on a disorderly-conduct charge, held for about 25 days, and then discharged. During this time the police became convinced that he ought to be examined for insanity, and he was so examined by Dr. King of the prison where he was confined. King, who seems to have had substantial experience in this line, reported that his intelligence was of low order, that his talk was rambling and he could not keep his mind on any given\n\n[50] line, but that he was not in his opinion dangerous. King made up his mind that Kristoff had nothing to do with Black Tom. Rigney and Charlock came definitely to the same conclusion. We do not know what Green thought, but the fact that Kristoff was discharged makes it certain that at the least the Jersey City police had not sufficient evidence to make the charge against him, and it is significant also that they did not keep Kristoff under surveillance or do anything else towards pushing the matter further. Their judgment is important, for they certainly had a good deal of the evidence now so strongly relied upon.\n\n[51] One of the main points now relied upon is the breaking-down of Kristoff’s alibi. But that alibi broke down at once. Kristoff on being questioned by the police said he was at the time of the fire at the house of his aunt at Yonkers. Green apparently went to his aunt’s house and was told he had not been there that night. It does not definitely appear that Green made further investigation on this point.\n\n[52] But we can have no doubt that the police, before letting go of Kristoff, not only cross-examined him thoroughly about this broken-down alibi but that they catechized Kristoff time and again about this and everything else suspicious or doubtful in his statements or his actions so far as they could learn of them; his returning late, why he was excited, why he said \"What I do! What I do!\", his Graentsor story — everything they could possibly think of. Rigney said he did his best before turning him over to the Jersey City police. Charlock said he examined him many times, the last time when he was discharged. Green and others of the Jersey police must have done the same thing. Green particularly could not have dropped the alibi after he had broken it down, or dropped Kristoff until he had tried to get some explanation. They must have got everything they could. We do not know whether Green was satisfied of Kristoff’s innocence, but Rigney and Charlock were. We cannot help giving weight to the fact that they discharged Kristoff when it would have been the great glory of any of these men to find and convict the culprit in this great disaster. And we might even suggest that the gentlemen of the press doubtless knew everything that the police knew, that many people who knew Kristoff knew that he was arrested and why, that reporters were questioning and hunting, and that any well-intentioned person who knew anything suspicious about Kristoff would have been likely to bring it to the attention of reporters or police authorities. The Black Tom disaster and Kristoff were certainly in the limelight.\n\n[53] The most extraordinary part of Kristoff’s story to the police was with respect to the man with the kaleidoscopic name, whom we will for convenience call Grantnor. According to Kristoff, Grantnor met him in the Pennsylvania Station in New York, asked him the time, got to talking, and then and there employed him to take with him a long trip, covering many cities, including cities as far west as Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis, staying from one to three days in these various places. He lent Grantnor $275, for which Grantnor was to pay him $5,000. He received from Grantnor only a few cents at a time, but at St. Louis Grantnor gave him a dollar to go to the theatre, and when Kristoff came back Grantnor was gone and Kristoff never saw him again except once when he met him by chance on the street in New York, when Grantnor agreed to get him a job and being in a hurry made an appointment for that night at the McAlpin Hotel, where, strangely enough, he was not to be found when Kristoff went there to get the job. Kristoff knew nothing whatever about what Grantnor did on these trips, except that Grantnor told him he was trying to get contracts. Grantnor had two suitcases which Kristoff said contained plans and blueprints. Kristoff’s sole duties were to carry the suitcases and to watch them when Grantnor was not in his room. Kristoff\n\n[54] did not go out with Grantnor in any of these cities, except for a casual ride or two, and did not see any of the people with whom Grantnor talked. He had asked Grantnor for his regular address but never got it. When first employed he was supposed to be paid $20 per week, but he never got even that.\n\n[55] The story is suspicious enough in all conscience. If Grantnor can be shown to be Hinsch, we can easily get a good deal of truth out of the story and add a good deal of detail. Hinsch himself testifies that he never went further west than Gettysburg.\n\n[56] But the first thing the story shows us is Kristoff himself. There is no danger that the story represents real facts, but it does represent Kristoff. Whether Kristoff was trying to tell the truth and couldn’t, or whether he was trying to make up a good-looking lie and couldn’t, we get a vivid picture of a simpleton, almost a plain fool, and we know that King is complimenting him when he speaks of him as a man of a low order of intellect.\n\n[57] That is in substance all the direct testimony we have at that time from Kristoff himself. The police had it and did their best with it. Charlock was particularly interested in Grantnor and asked Kristoff to try to find him and let Charlock know. Kristoff is now dead.\n\n[58] In the course of the later investigations of Kristoff we have alleged admissions by him, which are seriously important testimony, whatever doubts we may have regarding them.\n\n[59] These admissions are reported by a detective named Kassman, one of the men of the Burns Detective Agency, which was employed by the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company to shadow Kristoff. From October or November, 1916, to April, 1917, Kassman devoted himself to Kristoff, working in the same factory, getting intimate with him, eating with him, convincing Kristoff that Kassman was an anarchist and so acquiring his confidence, talking to Kristoff about the Black Tom fire and about the possibility of damaging other munition plants, which Kassman professed to Kristoff to be very anxious to do. The evidence shows that Kassman, whether a compatriot or not, could speak some language which Kristoff spoke naturally, and spoke little English himself. We judge therefore that their talk was not in English and that Kassman’s reports which in the evidence are in English must be translations of what Kassman reported in the language which he used in talking with Kristoff.\n\n[60] We have not all of Kassman’s reports. Why we do not know. We get the impression that the reports we have, which run along from the beginning of his employment to the end with varying intervals between the reports, were selected and put together in the shape submitted to us; not selected for the purpose of submission to us but for some other purpose. Very likely they were so selected because they seemed to the person making the selection to be the only important reports in a long series. Whatever the explanation, the reports as submitted to us omit much that seems important to us. We cannot accept at face value admissions appearing in reports from a detective when other reports from the same detective are lacking, which may conceivably contain denials, or explanations or sidelights, or statements of fact which are inconsistent with other circumstances which we know or with the alleged admissions.\n\n[61] And Kassman, entirely unconsciously, discredits every admission by Kristoff which appears in his reports. In his affidavit to the Commission stating that the attached are some of his reports and that they are true, Kassman undertakes to state, again in English, what Kristoff admitted to him,"}, {"id": "mcc_decision_1931", "title": "MCC Decision (30 Mar 1931)", "content": "MIXED CLAIMS COMMISSION\nUNITED STATES AND GERMANY\n\nLEHIGH VALLEY RAILROAD COMPANY, AGENCY OF CANADIAN CAR AND FOUNDRY COMPANY, LIMITED, AND VARIOUS UNDERWRITERS\n(UNITED STATES)\nv.\nGERMANY\n(Sabotage Cases)\n\nDECISION ON PETITIONS FOR REHEARING\nMarch 30, 1931\n\n***\n\n[1] Petitions for a rehearing have been filed by the American Agent in the so-called Black Tom Case on January 12, 1931, and in the so-called Kingsland Case on January 22, 1931. No new evidence is filed with these petitions. Although the rules of this Commission, conforming to the practice of inter- national commissions, make no provision for a rehearing in any case in which a final decree has been entered, these petitions have been carefully considered by the Commission.\n\n[2] The briefs previously filed in behalf of the United States and the detailed argument of its Agent at The Hague in September, 1930, were marked by ability and thoroughness to which was added the force of his sincere conviction. It is therefore not surprising that the present petitions for rehearing bring out no new argument. We have studied them carefully to see if we have misin- terpreted or misunderstood anything or failed to consider or to give due weight to any of the considerations now urged as a basis for rehearing. We are satisfied that we had a clear understanding of the Agent's position with respect to every point now presented and that every one of these facts or arguments was given careful consideration by us.\n\n[3] The terms of the Treaty of Berlin determine the financial obligations of Germany so far as this Commission is concerned. Both Governments and the Commission from the outset have recognized that in order to hold Germany liable for damages incurred during the period of neutrality this Treaty requires affirmative proof that such damages were the result of an act of the Imperial German Government or of its agents. The previous decisions of the Commission invariably have been based on this requirement. In the instant cases our conclusions were that the evidence did not convince us that the damages were the result of such acts. The substance of the petitions is that our conclusions were wrong. They may be, as we make no claim to infallibility, but they were and are our conclusions and nothing in the present petitions impairs our confidence in their correctness.\n\n[4] We think it futile to criticize the Agent's criticisms of our judgment, even of our good faith. One of his criticisms, however, which involves a jurisdictional question, calls for comment.\n\n[5] This question is raised by the American Agent's claim that the decision was irregularly rendered because the Umpire participated in the deliberations of the National Commissioners and in the opinion of the Commission. The Umpire participated in the deliberations of the Commissioners and in the opinion in accordance with the usual practice of the Commission in cases of importance since its foundation in 1922, a practice never before questioned and not in our judgment of doubtful validity even if it had not so long been accepted by all concerned.\n\n[6] These petitions for rehearing are dismissed. DECISIONS 103\n\n[7] A new jurisdictional question is raised in these petitions by the requests that subpoenas be issued by the Commission for the purpose of taking the oral testimony of certain witnesses. This suggestion is contrary to the unbroken practice of the Commission. The Agreement of August 10, 1922, between Germany and the United States, which established this Commission and is the foundation of its jurisdiction, does not authorize it to issue subpoenas for witnesses or to administer oaths and take the oral testimony of witnesses. The requests that subpoenas be now issued by the Commission for the purpose of taking oral testimony are based upon an Act of Congress approved July 3, 1930, having general application to international commissions, which the American Agent contends applies to this Commission and authorizes it to take this procedure. The Commission is of the opinion that the jurisdiction con- ferred upon it by the two Governments in their Agreement of August 10, 1922, cannot be extended by this later statute of the United States. Even if it had authority, the Commission would not change its practice at this stage of these cases, when the evidence has been formally closed, the arguments made, and the decisions rendered.\n\n[8] Accordingly, the requests in these petitions that the Commission issue sub- poenas for the oral examination of witnesses are also denied. In these petitions the American Agent states that he is collecting new evidence the submission of which will be the subject of supplementary petitions. Apart from the objection above noted to the taking of oral testimony, the Commission has pointed out in its decision denying the petition for rehearing filed by the American Agent in the Philadelphia-Girard National Bank case a number of objections to the submission of new evidence by either party as a basis for reopening or reconsidering decisions rendered in cases finally submitted. Some of these objections involve serious jurisdictional questions. The questions to be presented in the proposed supplementary petitions, however, are not dealt with by the Commission in this order, which deals only with the present petitions for rehearing on the basis of the evidence filed at the time these cases were submitted for decision.\n\n[9] Each of the two Governments has expressed a desire that the Commission wind up its labors as soon as practicable. All but a very few of the cases having been decided and there being only a comparatively small amount of work remaining to be done, it is necessary to set a final date by which each Agent should tender any further matter he may intend to ask the Commission to consider. That date is fixed as May 1, 1931.\n\n[10] Done at Washington March 30. 1931.\n\nSignatures:\n\nROLAND W. BOYDEN\nUmpire\n\nChandler P. ANDERSON\nAmerican Commissioner\n\nW.

The Commission reserved, however, for later decision\nthe question of reopening and reconsidering its original decision on new evidence\nwhich the American Agent had already announced he intended to submit\nby supplemental petition.\nThe question thus reserved is now presented by the pending supplemental\npetition, on which the present proceedings come before the Commission. In\nthese circumstances the only questions now to be dealt with are those raised\nby the submission of new evidence, and the Commission, accordingly, will\n\nDECISIONS \n105\nnot re-examine the findings of fact made in its original decision of October 16,\n1930, unless the Commission decides that it has jurisdiction to reopen these\ncases and the new evidence now submitted requires reversal or modification\nof such findings of fact.\nThe Commission has already heard, at its session held in Boston on July\n30—August 1, 1931, oral argument by both Agents on some of the issues\ninvolved. No decision was rendered at that time because the German Agent\nwas authorized to submit some additional information in regard to his conten-\ntion that certain documentary evidence presented by the American Agent was\nnot authentic. In consequence much additional evidence has been submitted\non both sides since the Boston meeting. For a considerable time during that\nperiod the Commission was without an Umpire, but on April 8, 1932, when\nthe Commission was again fully organized, it held a meeting in Washington\nand entered an order fixing definite time limits for the submission of any further\nevidence by either Agent. This order was amended, in agreement with both\nAgents, at a meeting held in Washington on November 1, 1932, and, as amen-\nded, required that the submission of evidence on both sides be finally closed\non November 15, 1932, and fixed November 21, 1932, and succeeding days\nfor oral argument on both sides, and the final submission of these cases at the\nclose of such argument.\nIn order to make the record complete, mention must be made of a motion\npresented by the American Agent on February 5, 1932, for the production by\nsubpoena of the Commission of certain witnesses for oral examination. The\nCommission had already dismissed, in its decision of March 30, 1931, a similar\nmotion by the American Agent, on the ground of lack of authority to subpoena\nwitnesses without the consent of both Governments. The new motion, renewing\nthis request, was opposed by the German Agent on behalf of his Government\nand, accordingly, the matter was referred, at the suggestion of the Commission,\nto the two Governments for direct action between themselves if they wished\nto confer the proposed authority on the Commission. Such authority has not\nbeen conferred by the two Governments, and accordingly, this new motion\nhas not been and cannot be considered by the Commission.\nThe foregoing brief review of the proceedings hitherto taken since the decision\nof October 16, 1930, brings the history of these cases down to the recent session\nwhich closed on November 25, 1932, when all the pending questions presented\nby this supplemental petition and the accompanying evidence were finally\nsubmitted.\nA preliminary objection to the reconsideration by the Commission of its\noriginal decision has been raised by the German Agent on the jurisdictional\nground that the Commission is without authority to admit the further evidence\nnow offered for consideration by the Agent of the United States, or to grant\na rehearing on the basis of such evidence, or any other evidence, after these\nclaims had been dismissed by the Commission in its decision of October 16,\n1930.\nThe Commission has taken note of this objection, but did not feel called\nupon to make a ruling on its validity at the outset. In all similar cases,\nincluding the proceedings on the original petitions for rehearing in these cases\nfiled in January, 1931, the Commission has invariably taken the position that,\nas stated in its decision of March 30, 1931, \" although the rules of this Com-\nmission, conforming to the practice of international commissions, make no\nprovision for a rehearing in any case in which a final decree has been entered,\nthese petitions have been carefully considered by the Commission \". The\nCommission has, accordingly, followed in the present proceedings the precedent\nthus established.\n\n1 06 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\nComing now to the issues raised by the newly-submitted evidence, it must\nbe noted, before discussing this evidence, that, as stated in the Commission's\ndecision on the former petitions for rehearing.\n\" The terms of the Treaty of Berlin determine the financial obligations of\nGermany so far as this Commission is concerned. Both Governments and the\nCommission from the outset have recognized that in order to hold Germany\nliable for damages incurred during the period of neutrality this Treaty requires\naffirmative proof that such damages were the result of an act of the Imperial\nGerman Government or of its agents. The previous decisions of the Commission\ninvariably have been based on this requirement. \nIn the instant cases our\nconclusions were that the evidence did not convince us that the damages were\nthe result of such acts.\"\nIt must also be noted that the Commission in its original decision of October\n16, 1930, stated that \" The Commission does not need direct proof but on the\nevidence as submitted we could hold Germany responsible if, but only if, we\nare reasonably convinced that the fires occurred in some way through the acts\nof certain German agents.\" In that decision the Commission also stated that\nin view of the background established in these cases, which showed authorized\nsabotage activities in the United States by a group of German agents, \" in-\nferences against Germany were rendered easier than they otherwise would be\",\nwhich means, in application to the present proceedings, that if the two men\nwho are now presented by the claimants as responsible for the Kingsland and\nBlack Tom fires respectively, namely, Theodore Wozniak and Michael Kris toff,\nare shown to have been German agents, or employed by German agents,\nat the time of those fires, the Commission might feel justified in inferring,\nunless such inferences were prohibited by other evidence, that Germany was\nresponsible under the Treaty of Berlin for those fires and liable for the resulting\ndamages.\nThe new evidence now submitted by the American Agent is intended to\nestablish such agency on the part of Wozniak and Kristoff.\nAs to the Kingsland case, the Commission in its original decision found as a\nfact that \" despite Herrmann's confession the evidence in the Kingsland case\nhas convinced us that Wozniak did not set the Kingsland fire \", and the Com-\nmission held as its final conclusion, from all the evidence, \" that the fire was\nnot caused by any German agent \" and, accordingly, that \" Germany cannot\nbe held responsible for it \".\nIn reaching its conclusion the Commission found, among other facts, that\nanother employee of the Agency of Canadian Car and Foundry Company,\nLimited, named Rodriguez, who also was alleged to be a German agent acting\nin cooperation with Wozniak in starting the fire, and to whom it was alleged\nthat $500 was paid as compensation by Herrmann after the fire, \" was not at\nthe Kingsland plant at all on the day of the fire \". The Commission also\nfound that the description of the starting of the fire, as presented in the evidence,\ndid not justify the belief that it was started by one of the incendiary pencils\nalleged to have been furnished to Wozniak and Rodriguez for that purpose,\nand, further, the Commission disbelieved that Wozniak was in Mexico after\nthe fire, where the evidence submitted by the claimants represented that he\nhad gone and consorted with admitted German agents.\nAs to the Black Tom case, the Commission was unable to find definitely,\nfrom the evidence filed prior to its original decision, just how or by what\nagency that fire started.\nAs a result of its examination of the record, the Commission found that\nthere was \" a good deal of evidence which tends to implicate Kristoff\". This\n\nDECISIONS \n107\nevidence related to his conduct on the night of the fire, his false alibi, his\nassociation and trips with a man whose name the Commission described as\n\" kaleidoscopic \" but, for convenience, called Grantnor, as it appeared in the\nrecord with many variations of that spelling, and it was attempted in the\nclaimants' evidence to identify this man with a man named Hinsch, an admitted\nGerman agent. The record also contained some alleged admissions by Kristoff\nreported by a private detective named Kassman, employed by the Lehigh\nValley Railroad Company.\nThe Commission examined had analyzed at some length all of the evidence\nand reached the conclusion, stated in its decision, that \" We cannot be sure\nthat Kristoff did not set fire to Black Tom or take some part in so doing. We\ncannot be sure that Graentsor, or Grantnor, or Graentnor was not Hinsch,\nand that Hinsch did not employ Kristoff and others who are unknown. But it\nwill sufficiently appear from the foregoing that, as we have said, the evidence\nfalls far short of enabling us to reach the point, not merely of holding Germany\nresponsible for the fire, but of thinking that her agents must have been the\ncause, even though the proof is lacking.\"\nThe new evidence now submitted on behalf of the claimants is addressed to\nall of these points in each of these cases, and is intended to show that the\nCommission was wrong in its findings and conclusions.\nThe American Commissioner and the German Commissioner have been\nunable to agree upon the decision of the questions presented in these cases as\naforesaid, and their respective opinions having been stated to the Umpire they\naccordingly certify the above mentioned cases and all the questions arising\nunder the supplemental petition therein to the Umpire of the Commission for\ndecision, except that the German Commissioner takes the position that the\nquestion of the jurisdiction of the Commission to re-examine any case after a\nfinal decision has been rendered is not a proper question to be certified to the\nUmpire on disagreement of the National Commissioners and reserves that\nquestion from this certificate.\nDone at Washington November 28. 1932.\nChandler P.

It is unnecessary to repeat what is\nthere set out. I proceed, therefore, without preliminary discussion to deal\nwith the cases in the situation in which I find them. I have had the aid of the\ntranscripts of the very full arguments made before the Commission at The Hague\nand at Boston and of full and satisfactory briefs filed in connection with the\nvarious arguments, especially the present one. I have examined large portions\nof the evidence filed prior to the decision of October 1G, 1930, with the object\nof comparing it with the new evidence in order to appraise the new evidence\nand its effect in connection with the old.\n\n108 \nUNITED STATES/GERM ANY\nKingsland\nMuch new evidence has been submitted for the claimants tending to exclude\nthe theory of industrial accident. It goes far to negative the belief that the\nfire occurred as a result of sparking of machines, undue friction, or disarrange-\nment of electrical apparatus. The Commission is asked to draw from these\nproofs the conclusion that Wozniak intentionally caused the conflagration. The\nantithesis is between an accidental fire and an incendiary fire set by a German\nagent. Nothing offered has changed or elaborated the account originally\ngiven and steadfastly adhered to by Wozniak. While there is now much\ncontradiction of the alleged improper functioning of the machinery (not testified\nto by Wozniak, but by others), there is some additional corroboration of\nWozniak's story. What was meant in the former opinion by \" industrial\naccident \" was one arising from any cause, whether or not accurately ascer-\ntainable. other than the purposeful act of an incendiary. While the new\nevidence makes more difficult the inference that the fire was due to one of\nthe causes suggested by Germany, it does not render easier the conclusion that\nit was intentionally kindled by Wozniak.\nIn the original record Herrmann detailed the instructions he claimed to\nhave given Wozniak. He says he told Wozniak to break the point of the\nincendiary pencil and set it upright in a coat-pocket or elsewhere and that it\nwould burst into flame within approximately 30 minutes. It is nowsuggested,\nas a deduction from expert testimony submitted, that if the pencil were laid on\nits side in the shellcase and crushed a flame would immediately be generated.\nBut there is no evidence that Wozniak knew this or was told that the pencil\ncould be so used. The new evidence as to conditions in the plant and the\nhappenings just before the conflagration, when added to the old, does not\nwarrant a finding that the fire was due to the intentional act of Wozniak.\nIn the decision of the Commission of October 16, 1930, it was found that there\nwas no sufficient proof that Wozniak was a German agent or in the pay of\nGerman agents. New evidence has been produced which is said to require a\nreversal of this finding. It may best be considered in relation to the state of the\ncase as it stood prior to the Commission's decision.\nThen it was claimed that Hinsch, a German agent, had introduced Wozniak\nto Herrmann, another German agent, who had given Wozniak incendiary\npencils and instructed him in the use of them ; that Herrmann doubted Wozniak's\nability and requested that another man be added to the force of incendiaries,\nwhereupon Hinsch produced a man named Rodriguez, who worked at the\nnext bench to that of Wozniak; that after the fire Rodriguez got into touch\nwith Herrmann and was paid $500; that Wozniak disappeared and never\nclaimed any pay but was ultimately taken or went to Mexico, where during\nthe summer of 1917, under the name of Karowski or similar name, he consorted\nwith German agents and was known as a German agent.\nThis version of the transaction depended for its validity in the first place on\nHerrmann's testimony, which was disbelieved by the Commission, and secondly\non that of some six witnesses who said they had either seen or heard of Wozniak\nin Mexico, under the name Karowski, or Karowsky or Karnowski, and knew\nhim to be a German agent. The Commission disbelieved this testimony. In\nApril, 1929, Wozniak came forward and gave testimony in affidavit form; and\nwas examined and rigorously cross-examined in July, 1930, and gave what\nthe Commission thought a truthful account of the fire and his subsequent\nconduct. His statements were carefully investigated by the Agents of both\ncountries, and not only by his testimony but by corroborative evidence obtained\nby the Agents the following facts are indisputably established. After the fire\n\nDECISIONS \n109\nhe submitted to an examination by the officials of the Agency of Canadian\nCar and Foundry Company, and also reported the nature and circumstances\nof the accident to Russian officials: he held himself available for further question-\ning. From the time of the fire to July 23, 1917, he was in New York City,\nusing his own name, boarding where he had previously been known, and part\nof the time a patient and a watchman in a hospital.\nHe says that about August 1 he went to Tupper Lake, N.Y., and worked\nas a lumberman, returning to New York City sometime about October, 1917.\nThis the American Agent disputes. Contemporaneous records are lacking,\nand testimony other than that of Wozniak is unsatisfactory as to this period.\nIt is certain, however, that sometime after January 1, 1916, and before Decem-\nber 31, 1921, Wozniak did work at Tupper Lake during a portion of a summer.\nFrom contemporaneous records and his own testimony it is clear that this was\nnot in 1916. By the weight of the evidence his employment as lumberman was\nnot in the summer of 1918, 1919, 1920, or 1921. If he was not in Tupper Lake\nin the summer of 1917 my judgment is that he was never there. Yet it is\nconceded by the American Agent that it is possible he did do summer work\nthere at some time during the period of years mentioned.\nFor reasons which will sufficiently appear from its original opinion the\nCommission definitely found that Wozniak was not in Mexico in the summer\nof 1917. Some of the affidavits to that effect presented by the claimants were\nwholly unsatisfactory in character, and others, while made by persons of the\nutmost probity, were proved obviously wrong by contemporaneous records.\nWozniak was in New York, living with his friends the Perrys and working in\nSchall's restaurant, early in November, 1917; and from that date forward\nhis whereabouts are accounted for, not alone by his testimony but by undisputed\nproofs. There is no evidence, except that which the Commission disbelieved\non the former hearing, that Wozniak ever used any other than his own name\nor that, as claimants assert, he purposely disappeared or that claimants could\nnot at any time prior to April, 1929, have located him.\nWith this background, I come to consider the new evidence. This falls\nunder three categories: (1) certain affidavits intended to prove that Wozniak\nwas in fact a German agent; (2) certain letters alleged to have been written\nby him from St. Louis, Mo., and Mexico City in August and September, 1917,\nand testimony as to the writing of three other letters by him from Mexico in the\nsummer of that year and as to his taking the name Karowski; (3) the so-called\nHerrmann message, which will subsequently be described and discussed. I\nshall consider these items in the order stated.\n1. The affidavit of Capitula is to the effect that in July or August, 1929,\nWozniak endeavored to persuade the affiant that he knew Wozniak in Tupper\nLake in \" 1917 and 1918 \"; and that the affiant refused so to state and informed\nWozniak that the affiant had been in Tupper Lake in 1920 and 1921. The\neffect of this deposition is purely negative. The evidence amounts to no more\nthan that the affiant could not say that he had seen Wozniak in Tupper Lake\nat any time. The witness does, however, add that Wozniak told him he had\nbeen in Mexico in \" 1917 and 1918.\" We know nothing of the witness Capitula;\nhis affidavit is barely a page long, lacks any collateral support; it attributes to\nWozniak statements which he certainly would never have made as to the year\n1918. The witness adds the somewhat surprising information that Wozniak\ntold him he had been \" brought back \" from Mexico. Is the inference to be\ndrawn that German agents brought him back?\nThe affidavit of one Nolan is produced, dated February 6, 1931, in which\nhe says that he knew Wozniak in 1916 and 1917 as a man \" used by different\nGerman Agents \"; that the witness saw Wozniak at Meyer's Hotel, Hoboken,\n\n110 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\nin company with Captain Hinsch. It contains an account of an incredible\nconversation said to have taken place between Hinsch and Wozniak overheard\nby the affiant. This witness was presumably always available to the claimants,\nand it is not clear why his testimony, if favorable, could not have been obtained\nlong before the case was originally submitted. I do not regard this evidence\nseriously. The same may be said of the affidavit of one King, offered in support\nof that of Nolan.\nAn additional affidavit by one Palmer was filed. He was in the employ of\nthe British Secret Service during the war and had, prior to the earlier hearing,\ngiven evidence apparently quite irrelevant to any issue then or now in the case.\nAnd, surprising to relate, he says not a word therein as to the matters to which\nhe now testifies. \nI must assume that he was thoroughly examined on the\nformer occasion. He now offers a most circumstantial account as to Wozniak\nand various German agents' activities. He explains that these matters are not\ndisclosed by contemporaneous British Secret Service reports because the custom\nwas to condense them and exclude hearsay; yet the very reports to which he\nrefers do contain hearsay information and on much less important matters\nthan those of which, at this late day, he speaks solely from memory. No\nexplanation is offered for his failure to disclose such vitally relevant details on\nhis former appearance as a witness.\nOne Glucas now furnishes an affidavit in addition to the one he gave origin-\nally. He greatly elaborates what he previously said and adds new matter\nwhich he says he previously withheld as he thought that the claimants had\nadequate information on the subjects about which he was interrogated, and\nso did not need his testimony. His explanations do not satisfy me of his candor.\nThese affidavits are all made with the purpose of attributing to Wozniak\nthe character and designation of a German agent. They are not persuasive,\nnot only for the reasons mentioned, but because I find that, save for the summer\nof 1917, as to which I shall speak in a moment, Wozniak, though open to\nsurveillance and for a part of the time under actual surveillance, has not in a\nsingle instance subsequent to the fire been found in the company of anyone\nwho might by the remotest stretch of the imagination be found to be a German\nagent.\n2. The new evidence indicates that in May, 1931, a Ukrainian named Baran\nwent to Mr. Peto, vice president of the Agency of Canadian Car and Foundry\nCompany, and exhibited to him three letters, addressed to Baran, written and\nsigned by Wozniak dated respectively St. Louis August 10, 1917, and Mexico\nCity August 28 and September 16, 1917. In connection with the production\nand examination of these letters the claimants paid Baran $2,500, and procured\nassent to a condition named by him that the American Agent should give\nassurance that Wozniak would not be prosecuted for perjury. The American\nAgent insisted upon an expert examination of the letters before he would accept\nthem as evidence. \nThe claimants consequently had them examined and\nsatisfied themselves and the American Agent that they were in Wozniak's\nhandwriting. \nExpert opinion indicated also that they were old and had\nprobably been written when they bore date. The letters were submitted to\nthe Commission. If genuine they establish that Wozniak was consorting with\nGermans in Mexico in the summer of 1917 and destroy his testimony to the\neffect that he was then in Tupper Lake. If they are not manufactured evidence\nthe Commission was wrong in disbelieving the witnesses offered at the earlier\nhearing and in finding that Wozniak did not go to Mexico.\nIn my opinion the letters are not authentic. I should arrive at this conclusion\nwithout the aid of expert testimony. But my finding is enforced by what I deem\nconvincing expert opinions that they were prepared for the purpose of the case.\n\nDECISIONS \nI 1 1\nThey purport to have been written at a time when war had been declared\nbetween the United States and Germany, and two of them must have been\nsent across the border, which was then under strict guard; one of them stated\nthat the Germans did not want Wozniak to write to anyone; two enjoin secrecy\non the addressee; one refers to \" my Germans \", another to the \" damned\nGermans \", — strange expressions to be used by a German agent consorting\nwith his fellows and seeking to conceal his whereabouts after fleeing the scene\nof his crime ! They are written in Ukrainian, but one of them contains the\nname Karowsky written in Roman letters and suggests that Baran write to\nWozniak by that name, to the general delivery address in Mexico City. Most\nnoteworthy is the fact that in one Wozniak says that he will soon be back in\nNew York near to \" King\". This is the sort of admission that Wozniak, above\nall men, in my judgment, would not naturally or normally have made. The\nreferences to Karowski and the Germans and to \" King \" too well piece out\nthe claimants' theory of the case.\nI am persuaded from photostats and photographs submitted that when\nBaran first showed the letters to the claimants they were not in the condition\nin which they now are. The various photostats prove that subsequent to such\nexhibition Baran cut a piece out of one of them. After this fact was noticed,\nthe explanation was offered that he did this so that he could have the paper\nanalyzed in an effort to prove the age of the letters because he had heard some\ndiscussion between the interested parties as to their authenticity. But Baran,\nby supposition, had had the letters since 1917; he needed no confirmation of\ntheir age. Moreover, photostats of the letters were attached to the affidavit of\nBaran identifying them, and the photostat of that of August 28, 1917, fails to\nshow certain distinctive stains which are now quite apparent not only on the\nletter but on all later photostats and photographs of it. The conclusion is\nirresistible that either Baran or someone else tampered with this letter, in an\neffort to give it the appearance of age, after it was first shown to claimants and\nbefore it was delivered to them by Baran to be used as evidence. These stains\nare relied upon by claimants' experts as evidence of the age of the letters.\nCertain foldings of two of the letters (those of August 10, 1917, and September\n16, 1917) are totally inconsistent with the claim that these were written on the\ndates they bear and separately mailed from the places they bear date.\nBaran, who produced the documents, is an intimate friend of Wozniak. The\nrecord before the Commission at the previous hearing discloses that he was\nrepeatedly in touch with Wozniak. His identity was fully disclosed prior to\nJuly 30, 1930, by Wozniak's testimony. From the cross-examination for the\nclaimants it is evident that they knew of this relationship at that time. It is\nincredible that Baran was not interviewed between the summer of 1930 and\nMay, 1931, when he appeared and offered the letters. If he had such letters,\nthat fact could have been long before ascertained.\nThe expert evidence and my own inspection convince me that the letters\nshow all the characteristics of artificially aged documents and that the expla-\nnation offered by claimants' experts of accidental staining is not credible.\nThe letter of August 28, 1917, was written upon a watermarked paper sold\nby Kiperman, a merchant of Warsaw. As early as June, 1931, the claimants\nhad observed the watermark and had procured a transmitted-light photograph\nwhich showed it with great clearness and definition of detail. During the sum-\nmer and autumn of 1931 they made investigations in Poland, and in France\nwhere a dandy-roll for the production of such a watermark had been manu-\nfactured, to ascertain the date of the manufacture of the paper. The investi-\ngation was not exhaustive, and made at best but a prima facie case for a date\nof the watermarked paper earlier than 1926. Kiperman's unsworn statement\n\n1 1 2 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\nwent no farther than that he had for many years sold paper with a similar\nwatermark; it is quite indefinite as to when such paper was manufactured.\nMuch detailed evidence submitted by the German Agent demonstrates that\nthe watermarked paper in question was not manufactured prior to 1926. Some\nconfusion has been created, due to the fact that two manufacturers made\npaper for Kiperman with dandy-rolls procured from different makers, but\nnon-expert inspection demonstrates to my satisfaction that the watermark in\nquestion is that made by the Mirkow factory from a dandy-roll made in Paris.\nThe paper made by the use of that dandy-roll was delivered to Kiperman not\nearlier than 1926. The expert testimony supports my own independent\nconclusion on this point. The watermark, therefore, strongly corroborates the\nother matters which make against the authenticity of the documents.\nIn June, 1932, there was filed an affidavit by one Golka, of Scranton, Pa.,\ndated December 9, 1931, in which he states that he received a letter from Wozniak\nin Mexico in 1917. At the same time two affidavits by one Panas and his\nwife of about the same date were filed, in which they recount the receipt of\ntwo letters from Wozniak postmarked in Mexico. Supporting affidavits state\nthat the names of these witnesses were obtained in Europe by Mr. McLain,\none of the attorneys for claimants, and that Mr. McCloy, another attorney\nfor claimants, secured the same names by independent investigation in this\ncountry. But the record contains references to both of these persons. In the\ncross-examination of Wozniak he was questioned and testified at length with\nrespect to them. \nIt appears from his affidavit and oral testimony that he\nworked under Golka in Scranton before going to New York in 1916, that during\nthe same period he lived in the house of Panas in Scranton and that Panas was\na witness to his marriage. It is somewhat difficult, therefore, to understand\nthe necessity for all this investigation to disclose these two persons, who perhaps\nare as close to Wozniak and know him as well as Baran and who would be the\nnatural persons to whom he and Baran would turn for statements in support\nof the Baran letters. Let it be here noted that, though unquestionably Wozniak\nwrote the Baran letters, he has testified that he was not in Mexico in 1917, has\nnot vouched for the letters, and is not to be prosecuted for perjury. \nIf the\naffidavits of Golka and Panas had been submitted independently, not merely\nas corroboration of the fraudulent Baran letters, I might, perhaps, give greater\ncredence to the evidence of Wozniak's friends. \nThese affidavits contain\nerroneous statements of fact ; and, moreover, both recite that Wozniak was\nanxious to have his letters from Mexico destroyed. In one case he is said so\nto have requested in the letter; in another case to have visited the addressee,\nobtained the letters, and destroyed them in the presence of his friends. The\nreason Golka says he gave was that he wished to conceal whence he was writing.\nThese are remarkable statements, when contrasted with the facts as to the\nfraudulent letters produced by Baran, which contain no such request but in\nfact give the name and address in Mexico to which letters may be sent to\nWozniak. If he were so anxious that his correspondence be destroyed, I can\nnot understand why he did not make a similar and effective request of his\nfriend Baran, if the Baran letters were genuine and the Golka and Panas\naffidavits exhibit his true attitude.\nSome of the witnesses who, prior to the decision of October 16, 1930, testified\nto Wozniak's presence in Mexico in 1917 identified a photograph of him as that\nof a man they knew as Karowski. Others stated they knew of the presence of\na German agent known as Kurowski, Karnowski, etc., without identifying\nWozniak as the one who bore that name. In the new evidence there is a\ncertificate by a police official in Poland to the effect that bordering on Wozniak's\nold home in Rawa Russka there is a forest in which Wozniak once worked,\n\nDECISIONS \n113\ncalled the \" Karowski \" forest; that in Poland it is common to take a name\nadditional to the surname, and to derive it from one's surroundings; that it\nis therefore probable that Wozniak did this, in which case he might have called\nhimself Wozniak-Karowski or Karowski-Wozniak. This evidence is pressed\nupon me as confirmatory of the testimony that Wozniak was in Mexico under\nthe alia1: of Karowski. But it rises no higher than proof that such a thing is\nneither improbable nor impossible.\nOn the other hand, testimony produced by Germany tends to prove that in\nthe tongue used in Rawa Russka the forest in question was, prior to Polish\ndomination at least, called \" Kariw \" (thus its derivative would be \" Karifski \"\nor \" Karivsky \"); that an intimate friend never knew of Wozniak's living in\nKariw or working in the forest in question and never heard him use or anyone\nelse call him or his family Karowsky or any similar name. This state of the\nproofs does not give me any real light upon the question of Wozniak's presence\nin Mexico.\nI am of opinion the matters above discussed are insufficient, when taken with\nthe proofs offered before the final hearing, to alter the finding that there is no\ncredible evidence that Wozniak was a German agent, was connected and con-\nsorted with German agents, or that he was in Mexico in 1917.\n3. If the so-called Herrmann message is authentic, that document alone\nwould compel a finding contrary to that I have just stated so far as concerns\nWozniak's being a German agent. \nSince, however, that message applies\nequally to Kingsland and to Black Tom, I may postpone discussion of it until\nafter I have considered the other new evidence relating to Black Tom.\nBlark Tom\nWith respect to this catastrophe the decision of October 16, 1930, held that\nwhile not satisfied that Kristoff did not have a part in causing the fire and\nexplosions, neither was the Commission convinced that he did have such part\nor that he was a German agent or an employee of German agents. The opinion\nstates that the Black Tom Terminal was a shining mark for the activities of\nagents of destruction and that Hinsch might well have desired its destruction;\nbut the only matter from which the Commission thought it might infer a\nconnection between Kristoff and Hinsch was the former's story of a journey\nmade by him with a man named Graentnor (or some similar name) early in\n1916 and the promise of a large payment from this person. The Commission\nwas unable from the record to identify Hinsch with Graentnor which it felt\nit must do in order to hold that Kristoff acted for Germany in causing the\nexplosion.\nThe new evidence offered in the endeavor to clarify the situation and to\ninduce an affirmative finding falls into two classes: (1) the 1916 diary and\ncertain checkbooks of Hilken; (2) the Herrmann message.\n1. It is said that the entries in the diary are consistent with Hinsch's having\nbeen absent from Baltimore on a trip with Kristoff in the spring of 1916. In\nthe earlier arguments it was contended that, as Kristoff claimed to have made\na trip at the time in question with a man he called Graentsor and as Fesmire\ntestified that Hinsch had once told him about having made a trip west, the\nCommission should conclude that Hinsch was Graentnor. \nHinsch, on the\nother hand, testified that he had never been west of Gettysburg and never\nmade such a trip as the one described and had never visited some of the cities\nmentioned by Kristoff. In this state of the record the Commission refused to\ndraw the conclusion suggested. In the light of these facts, I find merely that\nthe entries in Hilken's diary are not inconsistent with Hinsch's having made the\n\n1 14 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\ntrip but they add nothing affirmative to the evidence as contained in the record\nbefore and are insufficient to induce the affirmative finding asked by the\nclaimants.\nWith respect to Hilken's checkbook it is urged that this now makes certain\nwhat has heretofore been a matter of dispute, namely, that in August, 1916,\nshortly after the Black Tom explosion, Hilken paid $2,000 to Hinsch ; that this fact\ndestroys Hinsch's testimony that no such payment was made and casts discredit\non the whole of his evidence. The check stub shows that on August 10, 1916,\nHilken drew $2,000 in cash; on the stub is noted \" Capt H — Lewis, etc.\"\nHerrmann used the alias Lewis. It is undoubted that about August 6 or 7\nHilken, Hinsch, and Herrmann went to New London to inspect the harbor\npreparatory to making it a merchant-submarine base. I think that if Hilken\nwas in New York on August 10 he was on his return trip from New London.\nThe new harbor project undoubtedly required disbursements of money.\nHinsch states that the did not get S2,000 at this time and that the only expla-\nnation he can give of the entry on the check stub is that part of the money may\nhave been used for the expenses of the trip to New London, but he concedes\nthat these would not require anything like 552,000. This testimony is said to\nbrand him as untruthful. \nI can not adopt this view. The use to which the\nmoney was to be put still must be derived by the claimants from Hilken's testi-\nmony, heretofore given, contradicted as it is by Hinsch. I am asked to conclude\nthat as Kristoffsaid that he was to go to the Hotel McAlpin and meet Graentnor\nabout August 10 to receive a payment of a large sum of money this entry\nconnects Hinsch and Kristoff's travelling companion Graentnor. \nBut here\nagain we are taken into the realm of conjecture. Kristoff, moreover, said he\ndid not receive any money, and there is nothing else, unless the check stub be\nevidence of the fact, to show that he did. I find that the diary entries and the\ncheck stubs do not warrant the inferences I am asked to draw from them.\nThe Herrmann Message\n2. On July 1, 1931, there was filed with the Commission a Blue Book maga-\nzine of the January, 1917, issue, containing upon four printed pages lines of\nwriting running crosswise of the print. This, we are told, is a code message\nforwarded by Fred Herrmann in Mexico to Paul Hilken in Baltimore in April\n1917: names being referred to by numbers in the script, the numbers referring\nto other pages of the magazine where the names were indicated by pin pricks\nthrough printed letters in the text. The writing fluid is said to be lemon-juice\nmade visible by the application of heat. As decoded by Hilken the message\nreads :\nHave seen Eckhardt he is suspicious of me Can't convince him I come\nfrom Maguerre and Nadolny Have told him all reference Hinsch and I\nDeutschland, Jersey City Terminal, Kingsland, Savannah, and Tony's Lab.\nhe doubts me on account of my bum German Confirm to him thru your\nchannels all O.K. and my mission here I have no funds Eckhardt claims\nhe is short of money send ly [by] bearer U.S. 25000.— Have you heard from\nWillie Have wired Hildegard but no answer Be careful of her and connections\nWhere are Hinsch and Carl Ahrendt Tell Hinsch to come here I expect\nto go north but he can locate me thru Eckhardt I dont trust Carl Ahrendt,\nKristoff, Wolfgang and that Hoboken bunch If cornered they might get\nus in Dutch with authorities \nSee that Hinsch brings with him all who\nmight implicate us tell him Siegel is with me.

Most important send\nfunds Bearer will relate experiencies and details Greetings.\nA glance through this translation will indicate that, without reference to\nany other evidence, it is conclusive proof to any reasonable man that (a)\nHerrmann and Hilken knew the Kingsland fire and the Black Tom explosion\nwere the work of German agents and (b) that Hinsch, Hilken, and Herrmann,\nundoubted agents, were privy thereto, and (in the light of the record before\nthe Commission) (e) that Kristoff and Wozniak were active participants in\nthese events. As the American Agent has well said, I may utterly disregard all\nthe new evidence produced and still, if I deem this message genuine, hold\nGermany responsible in both of the cases.\nThe authenticity of the message is sharply challenged. A narrow and very\ndifficult issue of fact, upon which alone these cases now turn, is thus raised,\nwhich challenges and has had my careful and painstaking study in an effort\nto reach a right solution. As in the case of the Wozniak letters, the elements\nwhich affect the problem of authenticity fall into three general classes: (1) the\ntestimony concerning the document, (2) the conditions known to exist when\nthe message is claimed to have been transmitted, and (3) expert testimony\nwith regard tho the probable date of the writing.\n(1) The magazine was produced by Paul Hilken, who, in an affidavit of\nMay 8, 1931, states that he discovered it recently in his old home in Baltimore.\nThe document comes, therefore, from a source which the former opinion of\nthe Commission entirely discredited. Hilken, though an American citizen,\nis a former German agent. His attitude at first was that of loyalty to Germany.\nIn December, 1928, he changed his position and testified at great length on\nbehalf of the claimants. He then produced, upon request, diaries for 1915\nand 1917 and part of 1916 and other documents which were made a part of\nhis deposition. He then expressed his willingness to search for other contempo-\nraneous documents and indicated that they would be found either in his\ndesk or at this former home in Baltimore. The record leaves no doubt that the\nAmerican Agent and his counsel for a period of two years prior to the production\nof the magazine had urged Hilken to search out further data in substantiation\nof his testimony. Notwithstanding this he did not do so, and the Commission\nmade its finding of October 16, 1930, branding him unworthy of belief. There-\nafter counsel to the American Agent renewed his request and apparently hoped\nthat Hilken might find further documents to reestablish him in the eyes of the\nCommission. Nothing came of this until April 26, 1931, on or about which\ndate, we are told, Hilken brought the Blue Book to Mr. Peto, vice president\nof the Agency of Canadian Car and Foundry Company, and not, be it noted,\nto the American Agent or his counsel who had requested further data. Mr.\nPeto advised the American Agent of the existence of the document. Not until\nlong after the German Agent had attacked the authenticity of the message was\nfurther testimony of Hilken filed as to the time and manner of the discovery\nof the magazine.\nIn an affidavit made November 15, 1932, Hilken states that on Christmas\nDay, 1930, he made a search of the attic of his old home in Baltimore and\nunearthed the magazine at the bottom of a wooden box in a closet under the\neaves, and at the same time discovered a large amount of correspondence\nbearing on his wartime activities. Apparently none of this other matter was.\n\n116 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\ndelivered to the claimants with the magazine, but was filed with a later affidavit\nof Hilken dated June 29, 1931. Along with Hilken's affidavit of November 15,\n1932, were filed affidavits bearing date November 12 and 15, by Mrs. Hilken,\nHilken's daughter, and Elizabeth Braun. Mrs. Hilken states \" she knows \"\nthat on Christmas Day, 1930, Hilken found the magazine, though did not tell\nher of the message, but did inform her daughter as to it. She does not say\nthat she ever saw the document. The daughter simply underwrites her mother's\ndeposition; fails to state that she ever saw the document; and simply narrates\nby proxy of her mother's affidavit what her father told her. Elizabeth Braun,\nwho is in no way identified to the Commission, — about whom we know\nnothing except for her name and address, that she is an old friend of the Hilkens,\nand that she entertained Hilken the Sunday following Christmas, 1930, —\nsays that Hilken told her of the finding of an important message and described\nit ; she does not say that she saw it. All of these witnesses seem to have communi-\ncated the contents of their affidavits to the claimants during early or late 1931,\nbut their testimony was not submitted to the Commission until November 15,1932.\nHilken, in his deposition of November 15, 1932, and not before, gives as his\nreason for not promptly producing the message on its discovery, that he feared\npublicity as he knew that certain articles were being prepared on the sabotage\ncases to appear in the Liberty magazine ; also that he was being urged by von\nRintelen, then in this country, not to give any further evidence for the United\nStates. It is quite evident that Hilken had fully determined to aid the claimants\nas early as December, 1928. I do not believe that his attitude in that respect\nhad undergone any change. The von Rintelen advice is in my judgment a\nbelated excuse. Equally unsatisfactory is the suggestion as to avoidance of\npublicity. It is quite evident that Hilken could promptly have confidentially\nexhibited or delivered the magazine to the American Agent or his counsel,\nand that his confidence would have been respected.\nAs respects the production of the message, I find that it comes from a source\nwhich the Commission has held unworthy of belief, and under circumstances\nwhich at least cause me to hesitate to give full faith and credit to the account\nof its discovery.\nIn addition to Hilken's several depositions, there is a substantial amount of\nother testimony to be considered. Raoul Gerdts, a young man who associated\nwith Fred Herrmann in New York in 1916-1917 and who, while not a German\nagent, was an employee of Herrmann and did various errands and services\nfor him, accompanied the latter from the United States to Mexico in February,\n1917. Gerdts separated from Herrmann in 1917 and returned to his mother's\nhome in Colombia, South America. \nAbout January, 1929, the claimants\nlocated him there and submitted a questionnaire or series of interrogatories to\nhim, which he answered in writing. Amongst other things, he was interrogated\nas to whether he knew Hinsch and Hilken. In his answers he said that he\nhad met them in Baltimore in the spring of 1917 when he delivered the message\nor order with which he had been dispatched by Herrmann who was then in\nMexico. His testimony convinces me that he knew neither of them prior to\nthe Baltimore meeting. He said that he carried two messages, one for Hop-\npenberg (of the Eastern Forwarding Company in New York) and another to\nbe delivered to Hilken in case he should not find Hoppenberg ; that these were\nwritten in lemon-juice in a book of poetry. When his testimony was given and\nfiled apparently the parties, and certainly the Commission, attached no im-\nportance to the message, which seemed to be of a date insignificant in respect\nof the issues in these cases.\nIn 1930, after Fred Herrmann had decided to give evidence in support of\nthe claims and to return from Chile for that purpose, he remarked during the\n\nDECISIONS \n1 1 7\ncourse of his evidence that he had sent \" a couple of letters \" from Mexico\nto Hilken in Baltimore. Nothing further transpired in this connection until\nthe production by Hilken of the Blue Book magazine on April 26, 1931. There-\nupon Herrmann testified that he recognized it as \" the message \" which he\nhad sent by the hands of Gerdts to Hilken in April, 1917.

The American\nCommissioner is further of the opinion that the Commission has in general\nthe right in its discretion to reconsider a decision rendered by it, and that in the\nsabotage cases, inasmuch as the last decision of the Commission in those cases\nwas made by the Umpire on a Certificate of Disagreement by the national\nCommissioners, the Umpire can continue to act for the Commission in dealing\nwith this jurisdictional question as well as with all other questions arising under\nthe pending petition in those cases.\nThe German Commissioner disagrees with the American Commissioner\non all of the points above mentioned, and holds that the Commission has no\njurisdictional right to reconsider a decision once made, unless both Govern-\nments consent.\nThe written opinions of the National Commissioners, which have been\nsubmitted by them to the Umpire, showing the points and grounds of dis-\nagreement between them, are as follows:\nOpinion of the American Commissioner on the Question of Revision of Decisions\nThe Agreement of August 10, 1922, between the United States and Germany\nunder which this Commission was established, recites in its preamble that the\ntwo Governments \" being desirous of determining the amount to be paid by\nGermany in satisfaction of Germany's financial obligations under the Treaty\nconcluded by the two Governments on August 25, 1921, [Treaty of Berlin]\n* \n* * have resolved to submit the questions for decision to a mixed\ncommission \", etc. The Agreement further provides, in Article I, that the\ncommission shall pass upon specified categories of claims. The commission\nis to consist, as provided in Article II, of two national commissioners, one\nappointed by each Government, and an umpire selected by both Governments,\nbut eventually, by request of the German Government, appointed by the\nPresident of the United States. The umpire was authorized \" to decide upon\nany cases concerning which the commissioners may disagree, or upon any\npoints of difference that may arise in the course of their proceedings \".\nThe Agreement also provides, in Article VI, that \" The commission shall\nreceive and consider all written statements or documents which may be presen-\nted to it by or on behalf of the respective Governments \", and that \" The deci-\nsions of the commission and those of the umpire (in case there may be any)\nshall be accepted as final and binding upon the two Governments \".\nThere are no other provisions in the Agreement which have any bearing on\nthe question under consideration. No specific provision is made in the Agree-\nment for reconsidering or correcting any decisions rendered by the Commission.\nWhatever authority the Commission may have to reconsider and revise its\ndecisions must be derived from the provisions above mentioned, taken in\nconnection with the general powers discussed herein elsewhere, which were\nconferred on this Commission by the Agreement.\nDuring the course of the proceedings of the Commission many occasions\nhave arisen for taking action on correcting awards and reconsidering decisions.\n\nDECISIONS \n163\nAlthough no specific decision in any case where the point was at issue has been\nmade by the Commission on the question of its authority to take such action\nas a matter of principle, the Commission, in practice, has adopted a course of\nprocedure which demonstrates that in its opinion it had discretionary power to\nreconsider and revise its decisions to fulfill the purposes for which it was organ-\nized and to serve the ends of justice. It has always assumed, and acted on that\nassumption, that it was fully empowered to correct any clerical or pro forma\nerrors in its decisions or awards, and this has been done as a matter of routine\nprocedure. It has also assumed, and acted on that assumption, that on any\napplication for reopening and revising a decision on the merits the Commission\nshould receive and consider any evidence offered in support of such application,\nreserving for decision, after the examination of such evidence, the question of\nwhether or not the Commission, in its discretion, should grant the application\nbased thereon. The procedure adopted by the Commission, in dealing with\nsuch applications, has been, to recite, in the first place, the receipt of the appli-\ncation and the additional evidence offered in support of it, and then to state,\nin substantially the following form, that —\nAlthough the rules of this Commission, conforming to the practice of inter-\nnational commissions, make no provision for a rehearing in any case in which\na final decree has been made, nevertheless, the application and evidence sub-\nmitted in support thereof have been carefully considered by the Commission.\nIt so happens that hitherto in all the cases, in which rehearing petitions\nhave been filed, except those in which the two Agents agreed to a reopening,\nas hereinafter mentioned, the Commission has found that the grounds upon\nwhich they rested did not warrant reopening the case, or amending the terms\nof the decision, and the application in all such cases has been dismissed on\nthat ground.\nThe first case in which this question was presented was decided by the\nUmpire on August 31, 1926. In that decision the procedure above stated was\nadopted, and has thereafter invariably been followed both by the Umpire\nand by the national Commissioners in dealing with similar cases.\nIt seems clear that if the Commission had been of the opinion that under no\ncircumstances was it at liberty or empowered to reopen and reconsider a decision\nalready made it would not have entertained, even tentatively, a petition for\nreconsideration, but would have dismissed it as a matter of course without\nexamining or considering the grounds upon which it was made.\nNo question or objection to this mode of procedure was ever raised by either\nAgent until the question of reconsidering the Commission's decision in the\nso-called sabotage cases arose in January, 1931. The German Agent, in oppo-\nsition to the American Agent's petition for a rehearing in those cases on newly-\ndiscovered evidence, objected on the jurisdictional ground that the Commission\nwas without authority to admit the further evidence then offered, or to grant a\nrehearing on the basis of such evidence or any other evidence, after the claims\nhad been dismissed by the Commission.\nThe German Agent based his objection primarily on the ground that under\nthe Agreement establishing the Commission it had no inherent jurisdictional\npowers which would justify a revision of a decison once made, and that,\napart from any question of inherent powers, the Commission's jurisdiction on\nthis point was restricted by the above-quoted provision of Article VI that\n\" The decisions of the commission and those of the umpire (in case there may\nbe any) shall be accepted as final and binding upon the two Governments \".\nHe also asserted, in support of his contention, that in all cases in which any\nrevisions or corrections of decisions had been made this action had been taken\n\n164 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\nwith the consent of both Agents, acting for their respective Governments, and,\ntherefore, did not contravene his contention.\nThe American Agent, on the other hand, contended that, considering the\npurpose for which the Commission was established and the character of the\nduties imposed upon it, all authority necessary or appropriate to carry out its\nwork must be regarded as having been conferred upon it. On this basis, he\ninsisted that, inasmuch as the fundamental purpose of its creation was, as\nrecited in the preamble to the Agreement, to determine \" the amount to be\npaid by Germany in satisfaction of Germany's financial obligations \" under\nthe Treaty of Berlin, the individual and separate claims were each a part of\nGermany's entire financial obligation to be determined by the Commission,\nand until the total obligation was established no award or decision as to the\ncomponent items could be regarded as final, but meanwhile was always\nsubject to revision. *\nThe American Agent also contended that the Commission had inherent\npower to organize its work and procedure in any appropriate way which\nseemed to it advisable for the purpose of aiding in efficiently and expeditiously\nperforming its duties, and that unless the Commission had rendered decisions\nas rapidly as they could agree on them it would have been utterly impossible\nto make any headway in dealing with the gigantic task of disposing of 20,000\nclaims. Nevertheless, in adopting this plan of procedure, the Commission\nnecessarily had to hold in reserve the right to reconsider and revise any decision\nwhich, as the Commission proceeded through the mass of claims, seemed to\nbe inconsistent with information later acquired or with more mature views\nlater adopted in other cases. He, therefore, concluded that no decision was\nunalterably final until the work of the Commission was finally completed.\nIt so happened that before this issue arose the Commission had undertaken\nto lay down a series of rules for the guidance of the Agents on its attitude in\nregard to accepting new evidence as a basis for reconsidering decisions. These\nrules were set out in the Commission's decision dismissing a petition for\nrehearing in the case of the Philadelphia-Girard National Bank claim (Com-\nmission's Decisions, page 939). a\nOnly two of these rules have any bearing on the present question, and they\nwere:\n\" Where it appears that manifestly the Commission committed an error in its\nfindings of fact on the evidence produced by the Agents at the time the claim was\nsubmitted for decision, or in applying the principles of law and the rules of the\nCommission as established and applied in its previous decisions, the Commission\nwill take under consideration the question of reopening or changing the award.\n\" On the other hand where a rehearing is demanded merely on the ground\nthat by reason of newly submitted evidence the underlying facts were different\nI The decision of the Commission as announced by the Umpire with the concur-\nrence of both national Commissioners in The Lusitania Cases said (printed Decisions\nand Opinions, page 30) :\n\" The United States is in effect making one demand against Germany on some\n12,500 counts. That demand is for compensation and reparation for certain losses\nsustained by the United States and its nationals. While in determining the amount\nwhich Germany is to pay each claim must be considered separately, no one of\nthem can be disposed of as an isolated claim or suit but must be considered in\nrelation to all others presented in this one demand. In all of the claims the parties\nare the same. They must all be determined and disposed of under the same Treaty\nand by the same tribunal. * * * \"\n(Note by the Secretariat, \nVol. V I I , p . 42.)\nII Note by the Secretariat, \nthis v o l u m e , p . 69.\n\nDECISIONS \n165\nfrom those appearing in the record as submitted at the time of the decision, the\nCommission will not grant a reopening or a reconsideration of the award.\"\nThis decision, in which these rules were announced, was dated April 21,\n1930, and at that time the Commission thought it had practically finished its\nwork, and this set of rules was intended to serve as an aid to the Agents in\nbringing the work of the Commission to a conclusion by discouraging petitions\nfor rehearings, rather than as an administrative decision dealing with a juris-\ndictional question. This question had not, at that time, been presented and\nargued by the Agents, nor had the Commission had occasion to pass upon it in\nany submitted claim. This situation accounts for the rather incidental way\nin which these rules were announced. As the decision itself shows, the rules\nstated therein did not control or influence the conclusions reached by the\nCommission in dismissing the petition in that case. Accordingly, they did not\nhave the authority of a decision by the Commission on an issue argued and\nsubmitted by the Agents, and did not establish a precedent which the Com-\nmissioners would have felt called upon to follow in latter cases if they had\napplied it in the decision of an earlier case.\nAt this point it will be convenient to examine the principle on which these\nrules rested and some of the implications arising from them.\nBasically they assume an authority on the part of the Commission to deter-\nmine, in its discretion, whether or not it will reconsider a decision, which\nimplies jurisdictional power in the Commission to do so. if in its judgment that\nshould be done. That consideration would seem to establish that in the opinion\nof the Commission, at least, it had jurisdictional power to reconsider its earlier\ndecisions.\nIn further support of that view, it will be noted that the rule against recon-\nsideration deals only with cases where the \" rehearing is demanded merely on\nthe ground \" that the newly-submitted evidence changes the underlying\nfacts on which the decision was made. \nNothing is said by the Commission\nabout what its attitude would be if the new evidence disclosed misrepresentation\nor fraud as to the facts, or the suppression of material evidence. No case\npresenting such considerations was under consideration by the Commission at\nthat time, and it did not have such a situation in mind in announcing that rule,\nwhich applied more particularly to the consequences arising from delay or\nneglect on the part of the claimants in presenting their claim, rather than to\nthe more serious question which would arise under the other circumstances\nabove suggested. By announcing that rule the Commission certainly did not\nintend to preclude itself from taking different action if a different set of cir-\ncumstances demanded different treatment in the interest of justice and equity,\nor if the Commission had been imposed upon.\nThe implication of those rules was not that the Commission was without\nauthority to reconsider, but that there were certain circumstances in which\nit might exercise its authority, and other cases in which it would not be disposed\nto exercise that authority, which clearly indicated that, in its opinion, the exer-\nciseof that authority rested in the discretion of the Commission.\nIt may also be noted, in passing, that those rules did not apply to the so-called\n\" late claims \" submitted to the Commission by the Agreement of December\n31, 1928, between the two Governments. This is shown by the statement\nintroducing those rules in the decision, that they had \" general application to\npetitions and requests for rehearings as to the claims originally listed \". This\nexclusion of\" late claims \" from the application of those rules calls attention to\na significant difference between the jurisdiction of the Commission under the\nearlier Agreement and under the later Agreement.\n12\n\n166 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\nUnder the later Agreement the Governments expressly stipulated that\n\" late claims \" must be presented to the Commission \" with the supporting\nevidence within six calendar months from the first day of February, 1929 \".\nThe Commission ruled that this provision precluded it from receiving any\nsupporting evidence for any purpose after the period thus fixed.\nUnder the earlier Agreement of August 10, 1922, which applied to the\nsabotage claims, no time limit was set for the presentation of evidence or the\nfinal submission of claims to the Commission for decision. It merely provided,\nin Article VI, that \" The commission shall receive and consider all written\nstatements or documents which may be presented \", etc. In applying this\nprovision, the Commission ruled that it was not at liberty to fix a time limit\nwithin which a claim must be submitted, and could not refuse to receive new\ndocuments or written statements offered by either side even after a claim\nhad been formally submitted for decision. \nUnder the authority of this\nprovision, such new evidence was actually received by the Commission on\napplication by the German Agent after the first oral argument and submission\nof\" the sabotage cases at the session in Washington in April, 1929. It must\nbe observed, however, that this ruling did not deal with the question of the\nintroduction of new evidence after the Commission had actually rendered a\ndecision, which question, as herein elsewhere stated, was always reserved for\nspecial consideration.\nThe chief significance of this difference in the two Agreements is that it\nshows that when the Government desired to place a limitation on the juris-\ndiction of the Commission they put it in the Agreement.\nAt the time those rules were announced there was no case pending to which\nthey applied, and neither Agent discussed them with the Commission.\nLater on, after the rehearing petitions in the sabotage cases came up in\nJanuary, 1931, both Agents argued about those rules at some length, seeking\nto interpret them in support of their respective contentions. The Commission,\ndesiring to determine this question on a basis of principle, rather than on an\ninterpretation of those rules so casually announced, addressed a letter to the\nAgents, under date of March 30, 1931, indicating that, whatever purpose those\nrules were intended to serve at the time they were announced, they were\n\" not irrevocable \" and should be disregarded in discussing the question of\nrevision then under consideration. 1 They added, \" it is desirable that argu-\nment addressed to the question should be devoted not to the interpretation\nof that language but to the principle itself\".\nSubsequently, at the session held by the Commission in Boston in July-\nAugust, 1931, to consider the reopening petition in the sabotage cases, the\nCommission permitted the submission, provisionally, of a quantity of new\nevidence, and heard extensive oral argument of both sides on the question of\nthe merits of the claims as well as on the question of jurisdiction to reopen.\nNo decision on this question was announced by the Commission at that time,\nand since that hearing the Commission has not only received, but has expressly\ninvited the submission of, new evidence in the sabotage claims, produced at\nconsiderable expense by both sides, and at a session in Washington in Novem-\nber, 1932, heard oral argument on the issues presented, involving not only the\njurisdictional question of its right to reconsider the original decision but also\nthe merits of the claims as affected by the new evidence.\n1 On this point attention is called to the fact that the Rules as originally adopted\non November 15, 1922, contained at the end of Rule VIII the provision that\n\" The decisions in writing ( 1 ) of the two Commissioners, where they are in agreemen t,\notherwise (2) of the Umpire, shall be final \", but this Rule was revised on February\n14, 1924, and this provision was stricken out.\n\nDECISIONS \n167\nThroughout the proceedings of the Commission, while the question of\nreconsidering its decision in the sabotage cases was pending, the Commission\ncarefully refrained from any formal announcement of its opinion on the juris-\ndictional question. The German Agent's position was noted in the record,\nand the proceedings of the Commission were explicitly stated to be without\nprejudice on this question, which was specifically reserved for decision\nat the close of the proceedings.\nThe foregoing is a full and impartial exposition of the attitude and record\nof the Commission on the question of its jurisdictional power to reconsider a\ndecision, as the record stood, down to the time of the argument and the sub-\nmission of that question to the Commission at its session in Washington in\nNovember, 1932.\nIn the argument at that Washington session both Agents again discussed\nthis jurisdictional question, and the Umpire, in the course of the argument\n(transcript, page 787 [printed, transcript, page 244]), clarified that issue in the\nfollowing dialogue with the German Agent:\n\" THE UMPIRE. What I understood and what we all understood the German\nAgent to suggest was that he presents to this Commission the proposition that its\nconstruction of the treaty should be that it has no power now to rehear this case.\nI did not understand him to take the position that the Commission could not\nconsider the question of its own jurisdiction. If he desires to clear that question,\nhe may do so.\n\" THE GERMAN AGENT. The understanding of the Commission is entirely correct.\n\" THE UMPIRE. In other words, that is a justiciable question here.\n\" THE GERMAN AGENT. Yes.\"\nThe American Agent agreed with the German Agent on this point. Ac-\ncordingly, the Commission had an authoritative statement from the official\nrepresentatives of both Governments that the question of the power of the\nCommission to receive new evidence and reconsider a decision already rendered\nwas a justiciable question, the decision of which was within the jurisdiction\nof the Commission.\nIt will be recalled that the Agreement establishing this Commission was\nmade between the Executive branches of the two Governments, and did not\nhave the status of a treaty. It could, therefore, be interpreted or amended by\nsimilar agreements between the Executive branch of the Governments, and it\nwas thac branch of their respective Governments for which the two Agents\nwere the spokesmen in stating their understanding of the jurisdiction of the\nCommission to determine its own jurisdiction on this point.\nThe German Commissioner apparently disagreed with his Government\non this point, as appears from his reservation of it from submission to the\nUmpire in the national Commissioners' certificate of disagreement. He there\nstated that \" the German Commissioner takes the position that the question\nof the jurisdiction of the Commission to re-examine any case after a final\ndecision has been rendered is not a proper question to be certified to the Umpire\non disagreement of the National Commissioners and reserves that question\nfrom this certificate \".\nJust what the German Commissioner meant by this reservation is not clear,\nand is subject to explanation, but, in the opinion of the American Commissioner,\nneither of the national Commissioners has the authority to overrule or disregard\nan agreement made by the two Governments as to the jurisdiction of the\nCommission, and the two Governments certainly have agreed in this point,\nas evidenced by the above-quoted statement of the German Agent in oral\nargument, concurred in by the American Agent.\n\n168 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\nThere is one more point to be noted in support of the position that the\nCommission has the right to reconsider a decision as a matter of jurisdictional\nauthority. This point arises from the fact that there is no provision in the\nAgreement of August 10, 1922, which limits or prohibits that right. The\nCommission was established by that Agreement without limitation or condition\nas to its authority to carry out the duties assigned to it, except the conditions\nwhich were embodied in the provisions quoted at the outset of this discussion.\nIn none of those provisions will be found any condition or even a suggestion\nthat the method and procedure, or the basis of judgment, to be adopted by\nthe Commission in performing its duties did not rest wholly in its own discretion.\nIt is true that the German Agent contends, as above indicated, that the stipula-\ntion in the Agreement as to the finality of the Commission's decisions precludes\nthe reconsideration by the Commission of any decision rendered by it. In the\nopinion of the American Commissioner this stipulation is addressed to the two\nGovernments, rather than to the Commission, and applies only to decisions\nwhich the Commission itself, after the exercise of its judicial and discretionary\npowers, regards as no longer subject to revision, or by reason of its final termi-\nnation is no longer in a position to deal with. '\nOn the other hand, the rules adopted by the Commission pertain to remedies,\nrather than rights, and were addressed by the Commission to the Agents and\nclaimants as an expression of its attitude on matters wholly within its juris-\ndictional powers.2\nAs showing the wide discretionary powers conferred upon the Commission,\nit will be noted that the members of the Commission were not required to take\nan oath of office, as usually is exacted in international arbitrations, that they\nwould render their decisions in accordance with the principles of international\nlaw, or justice, or equity. It is true that treaty interpretation, rather than\ninternational law, ruled the greater part of the decisions of the Commission\non the claims submitted, but the fact remains that the Commissioners were\nentrusted with the interpretation of the Treaty without any limitations whatso-\never, and treaty interpretation involves many important questions of inter-\nnational law. The two Governments recognized that the Commission must\nnecessarily be a law unto itself in this unexplored area, and relied wholly\non the sound judgment and sense of justice of the Commissioners in establishing\nwhat might be called the \" law of the Commission \".\nIn this respect the Commission is unique among international claims com-\nmissions, and, for that reason, must be regarded as standing in a class by itself.\nArguments as to its powers drawn from the proceedings of other claims com-\nmissions differently conditioned and organized are of no value here, and those\nadvanced by the Agent of Germany based on precedents found in the procedure\nof other commissions, accordingly, do not require consideration.\n1 See footnote 5.\na As said in Administrative Decision No. V (printed Decisions and Opinions,\npages 186-187):\n\" * * * The American nationals who acquired rights under this Treaty\nare without a remedy to enforce them save through the United States. As a part of\nthe means of supplying that remedy this Commission was by Agreement created\nas the forum for determining the amount of Germany's obligations under the\nTreaty. That Agreement neither added to nor subtracted from the rights or the\nobligations fixed by the Treaty but clothed this Commission with jurisdiction over\nall claims based on such rights and obligations. The Treaty does not attempt to\ndeal with rules of procedure or of practice or with the forum for determining or\nthe remedy to be pursued in enforcing the rights and obligations arising therunder.\n* * * \" (Note by the Secretariat, Vol. VII, p. 149.)\n\nDECISIONS \n169\nThe American Commissioner finds, accordingly, that the Commission has,\nand was intended by the two Governments to have, extraordinary and extensive\npowers far beyond those specifically mentioned in the Agreement establishing it.\nThese extraordinary powers are inherent in the entity thus established, and\ncomprise any and all authority necessary and appropriate for carrying out its\nduties, and the Commission may determine in its own discretion the extent of\nthese powers and how they shall be exercised, subject always to whatever\nlimitation or control the two Governments may impose by joint agreement\nbetween themselves.\nAs yet, the two Governments have not agreed to any limitation of the Com-\nmission's power to reconsider decisions, but, on the contrary, have, through\ntheir official representatives before the Commission, affirmed that this question\nis a \"justiciable question \" within the jurisdiction of the Commission to deter-\nmine for itself. In other words, it rests in the discretion of the Commission to\ndecide whether or not any decision should be reconsidered on new evidence\nor argument submitted on a petition for rehearing, or on its own motion if\nit finds that it has been imposed upon.\nThe American Government has already expressed its opinion on this point\nthrough Secretary of State Stimson, who stated, in a letter to the Secretary of\nthe Treasury dated February 16, 1933, \" In my opinion, it is solely within the\ncompetency of the Commission to decide as to the reopening of cases which\nhave been heard and adjudicated by it.\"\nIn conclusion, the American Commissioner is of the opinion that the rules\nannounced in the Philadelphia-Girard National Bank case decision do not\napply to the question under consideration, and also that, as already stated\nby the Commission, they, like any other rules adopted by the Commission,\nwere subject to revision and were not irrevocable. Furthermore, it should be\nmade clear that the Commission will consider new evidence in support of a\nrehearing petition showing misrepresentation or fraud as to the facts or the\nsuppression of material evidence, or that the Commission has otherwise been\nimposed upon, or that new evidence not previously available has been discov-\nered which would justify a different decision.\nIn such cases the Commission has the power, and will exercise it in its\ndiscretion, to reconsider a previous decision. This right to reconsider should\nbe applied only to a limited and special class of cases. It may be noted, however,\nthat the Commission, by its previous careful and well-considered action in\ndealing with matters entrusted to its discretion in these proceedings, has\nabundantly demonstrated that it will not abuse its discretionary powers in\ndealing with reopening petitions. It will be recalled that it has not as yet\ngranted any such petition. It may also be noted that the American Agent has\neffectively cooperated with the Commission in its efforts to complete the work\nof the Commission as promptly as possible, by refusing, on his own responsibility,\nto present several hundred applications for rehearings which he considered\nwere not well-founded.\nThe Commission cannot announce in advange any general rule as to how\nthis right will be exercised because that would depend in each case on whether\nor not the facts presented satisfied the Commission that in its discretion the\nright should be exercised.\nThis procedure is consistent with the course hitherto followed by the Com-\nmission in dealing with rehearing petitions. Any other course would amount\nto criticism and repudiation of its previous action. Unless the Commission\nhad the right to reconsider a decision, it was absolutely without justification\nfor hearing two extensive and very expensive re-arguments in the sabotage\ncases, which have prolonged the life of the Commission for upwards of two\n\n170 \nUNITED STATES/GERM AN Y\nyears, at considerable expense to both Governments and, incidentally, great\nadditional expense to the American claimants in procuring the new evidence\nsubmitted. In the opinion of the American Commissioner the Commission\nwould not, and should not, have adopted that course unless the Commission\nbelieved it is authorized to revise its decision in these cases if the new evidence\nand arguments presented justified that action.\nChandler P. ANDERSON\nAmerican Commissioner\nWashington, June 21, 1933.\nOpinion of the German Commissioner on the Question of \nReopening\nThe question whether this Commission has the power to reopen a case has\nfully and thoroughly been dealt with by the two Agents in some of their briefs\nin the so-called sabotage cases and in the oral argument held in Boston July 30,\nAugust 1, 1931.\nAfter carefully having examined the arguments proffered from both sides\nI wish to state my opinion as follows:\nIn dealing with the issue now before the Commission it must be kept in\nmind, that this Commission is an International Commission, an International\nCourt. Therefore as to its rules undoubtedly no principles specifically American\napply.\nEven if from reasons unknown to me every court in the United States —\nFederal as well as State Court — would be considered as having the \" inherent\npower \" to reopen a case, such power would have no bearing whatever on the\nquestion whether an international Court would have the same right. There is\nno doubt that in Europe at least no continental Court of the leading nations\nand certainly no Court in Germany has such power except when and where it\nis transferred to it by a special legislative act or provision. But even as to the\npower said to be \" inherent \" in the courts of the United States, the convincing\nforce of the argument offered by the American Agent is strangely weakened by\nan instance so much relied upon by himself: the instance has been taken from\nthe law of California and the Report by the Law Enforcement Commission.\nThe reason that in the wellknown Mooney and Billing case the Californian\nCourt declined a petition for reopening and that said Commission took\nexception to this result, was not because the Commission thought the Court had\nviolated the law by denying its right to reopen, but because it thought the\nlegislation of the State California should have provided for a law transferring such\npower to the court.\nHardly a better illustration of the nature of the American Agent's error can\nbe found: the right to reopen is not a power inherent in the court, but a power\ninherent in the sovereignty of a State to establish such right and to authorise\na court to do so under the conditions and modalities the sovereign thinks fit.\nWithout such authorization no court neither in the United States nor anywheie else\nhas a right to reopen.\nAnd no international court can claim such right but by the authority from\nthose powers which called it into life.\nHere again the American Agent erred when from the fact that some of the\nMixed Tribunals created by the Treaty of Versailles have provisions dealing\nwith a possibility to reopen he concluded that such power must have been\ninherent in those courts, and he committed a further error when he reached\nthe conclusion that therefore such power was also vested in this Commission.\nThe German Agent has already pointed out, that those tribunals had\nespecially transferred to them the power to make their own rules by the Treaty of\n\nDECISIONS \n1 7 1\nVersailles and that under the authority of the power thus transferred the court\nby unanimous decision adopted such rules which thereupon were approved by the\nPowers concerned and published in the official Journals destined to promulgate\nthe legislative acts of said Powers.\nMoreover the instances as cited by the American Agent show that the courts\nconsidered it necessary to make a special provision in order to establish the\nright of reopening and that f.i. the Anglo-German Tribunal, making such\nprovision in the year 1925, was far from making it retroactive, thus clearly\nshowing that it did not consider such right to reopen as an inherent right\napplicable therefore to all cases brought before it, but as a right which could\nonly be brought into effect by a specific provision (under the authority of\nthe provisions of the Treaty of Versailles) and which therefore could be applied\nonly to cases not yet decided by the tribunal and therefore not being \" res\njudicatae \". \nMoreover a more thorough examination of the nature of the\nalleged \" inherent power \" of a court and especially of this Commission will\nshow that the question so generally formulated and so broadly dealt with by\nthe American Agent comprises a rather considerable number of \" sub-ques-\ntions \" — which it will be necessary to examine separately.\nI. The theory of an \" inherent power \" of a court to reopen a case is not\nborne out by the instances offered by the American Agent even as far as\nAmerican domestic courts are concerned. As already pointed out, courts are\ncreated. Created by an act of legislation, deriving their authority from the\nsovereign power of a nation, represented in a written or unwritten constitution.\nThus it is a derivative power exclusively depending on the volition and intention\nof its sovereign.\nTo show that a court has a certain power means therefore the obligation\nto show that such power was transferred to it (thus f.i. power and scope of its\njurisdiction etc.). Such transfer could be made either by the act creating the\ncourts, transferring thereby a specific right to a court as such or by a special\nact of legislation.\nIn either case it needs a specific provision. Therefore it would need a clear\nand unambiguous proof that a right, as f.i. a right to reopen, had been trans-\nferred to it. But this is exactly the opposite to what the American Agent\nconsiders to be an \" inherent \" power of a court.\nObviously the legislative policy as to the scope of the powers to be transferred\nto a court will vary in several nations and actually differ very much. No\nreason whatever therefore exists to conclude from the fact that one state\nprovides by its legislation for a reopening measure, that therefore other nations\ndid the same.\nMoreover even if two nations should have made similar provisions in that\nregard for their domestic courts that would never justify the conclusion that\ntherefore an international court created by those two nations must necessarily\nhave the same power. Here again it needs a specific creative act, to wit the\nclear and unambiguous volition and intention of the two sovereign Powers\nconcerned to vest in an international court created by them such power.\nNo argument is necessary to state that in the Agreement of August 1922 no\nprovision exists authorising the Commission to reopen a case. Yet the Agree-\nment of August 1922 is the only charter of this Commission as to its rights to\nproceed.\nThe right to reopen is therefore not transferred upon this Commission.\n(This does not mean that the Commission or the two national Commissioners\nmight not unanimously agree to correct a decision, as I will discuss under\nNo. 7.)\n\n172 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\n2. But even if the authority to reopen would have been transferred to the\nCommission it still would be within the volition of the Commission whether\nit would be willing to use such authority or not.\nIn that case the Commission had to say so, which means that it had to make\nthe right to reopen a specific part of its rules.\nBut no such provision has been made.\nInstead the Commission has already and unambiguously expressed its will\nto the contrary.\nIt has done so in its decision on the Petition to Reconsider an Award in the\ncase United States of America on behalf of Philadelphia-Girard National\nBank, Claimant v. Germany and Direktion der Diskonto-Gesellschaft, Implea-\nded. Docket No. 7531, List No. 2729.\nThe Decision reads as follows:\n\" In this case a final award was entered by the Commission on April 3, 1929.\nA Petition for the Reconsideration of this award, signed by the claimant and\npresented through its attorneys to the American Agent, has been submitted to\nthe Commission together with certain additional evidence and a printed Memo-\nrandum in support thereof, dated August 7, 1929, and prepared by the private\ncounsel for the claimant.\n\" Although the rules of this Commission, conforming to the practice of international\nCommissions, make no provision for a rehearing in any case in which a final decree\nhas been made, this Petition and the supporting Memorandum and evidence\nhave been carefully considered by the Commission.\n\" Before taking up the questions raised by this Petition, the Commission desires\nto announce certain principles having general application to petitions and re-\nquests for rehearings as to the claims originally listed, by which the Commission\nwill be guided in dealing with this and other similar applications.\n\" Where it appears that manifestly the Commission committed an error in its\nfindings of fact on the evidence produced by the Agents at the time the claim was\nsubmitted for decision, or in applying the principles of law and the rules of the Com-\nmission as established and applied in its previous decisions, the Commission will\ntake under consideration the question of reopening or changing the award.\n\" On the other hand, where a rehearing is demanded merely on the ground that\nby reason of newly submitted evidence the underlying facts were different from\nthose appearing in the record as submitted at the time of the decision, the Com-\nmission will not grant a reopening or a reconsideration of the award.\n\" The reconsideration of a claim after a final decision has been rendered would\nmean that the whole case would have to be dealt with anew. The new evidence\nsubmitted would have to be brought to the attention of the opposing party, which\nwould have to be given a reasonable time to investigate and file additional or\nrebuttal evidence on its side, and also an amended answer or a reply, if that was\nfound to be necessary, and then the whole case would have to be reexamined and\ndecided again. All of these consequences would result from the failure or neglect\nof the moving party to produce the additional evidence before the claim was\noriginally submitted for the decision of the Commission.\n\" Moreover, if the production of new evidence by a party would give the right\nto have the whole case reopened, such right would necessarily attach not only\nto every claimant whose claim had been submitted and decided, but also to the\nrespondent in each case as well.\n\" If such a right were granted and exercised at this advanced stage of the pro-\nceedings of the Commission, it would affect awards which have already been\npaid, and, apart from the confusion resulting from such procedure, it would be\nclearly contrary to the express wording and manifest purpose of the Agreement\nof August 10, 1922, between the United States and Germany. According to that\nAgreement the decisions of the Commission are accepted as final and binding upon\nboth Governments, and, inasmuch as the governments are primarily the parties in\ninterest, the private claimant, on whose behalf the Government of the United\nStates has finally submitted a claim for decision, cannot be given the right to alter\n\nDECISIONS \n173\nor nullify this situation by producing new evidence changing the status of the\nclaim as submitted and decided.\n\" It is also pertinent to consider that most of the applications which have been\nmade for rehearing have arisen in cases in which the Commission has pointed\nout wherein the claimant has failed to furnish evidence sufficient to establish the\nliability of Germany under the Treaty of Berlin, as interpreted by this Com-\nmission, and to grant a rehearing in those cases would mean a great injustice to\nthe great majority of the claimants whose claims were dismissed by the Commission\nwithout indicating wherein the evidence submitted was insufficient, and, who,\ntherefore, have been unable to discover new points of attack. It may also be noted\nthat in no case, as yet, has the Commission granted an application to reopen a claim in which\na final decision has been rendered.\n\" The Commission will not consider questions of law, which have been settled\nin its earlie"}, {"id": "resignation_huecking", "title": "Resignation Letter - Huecking (1939)", "content": "REPORTS OF INTERNATIONAL\nARBITRAL AWARDS\nRECUEIL DES SENTENCES\nARBITRALES\nMIXED CLAIMS COMMISSION UNITED STATES AND GERMANY: \nAppendices\nVIII\npp. 469-511\nVOLUME\nNATIONS UNIES - UNITED NATIONS\nCopyright (c) 2006\n\nAPPENDICES. \n493\nit desirable to give finality to the settlement heretofore reached in the Drier case.\nI agree with Your Excellency that the Commission shall not in future be asked\nto consider any new cases or cases already decided, other than the sabotage cases\nand the case of Mrs. Katherine McNider Drier.\nAccept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.\n(Signed) Cordell HULL\nHis Excellency\nHeir Hans LUTHER,\nAmbassador of Germany.\n(C) Excerpts from Minutes of Commisiionfor Meeting Held October 30, 1939, pp. 1725-1726\n[Following the announcement of the decision of the Commission by the Umpire\nof October 30, 1939, in Docket No. 81 17, the Minutes then show that:]\nThe American Commissioner then made the following statement:\n\" In accordance with the order entered on June 15, 1939. the American Agent\nand the Acting American Agent prepared and submitted to the Commission for its\napproval memoranda relating to all the pending sabotage claims and the awards\nto be entered.\n\" Some of the questions which have arisen in the study of these cases arc of a\nlegal character, in which I have furnished the [p. 1726] Umpire memoranda of the\nActing American Agent and memoranda prepared by me relating thereto.\n•' I have thoroughly examined the files for the purpose of determining the correct\nmeasure of damages in all of these cases, and have furnished the Umpire memoranda\nrelating thereto.

C ,\nThe German Commissioner \nMarch 1, 1939.\nMixed Claims Commission\nMy dear Mr. Justice Roberts:\nI beg to apprise you of the fact that I retire from the post of German Member\n\n494 \nUNITED STATES GERMANY\nof the Mixed Claims Commission. \nPlease consider running appointments as\ncancelled.\nThe reasons for my step are these :\nOur deliberations began with discussing whether there was a prima facie case\nmade out by the claimants and at once one fact became conspicuous: In respect to\nthe largest of our claims you introduced as your main point a point which was not\nmade by the claimants at all and which, as far as I am aware, never was argued.\nIt may be recapitulated in a few sentences:\nWhen our Commission rendered their decision at the Hague, they had before\nthem two American witnesses and one German witness [p. 1704] testifying to the\ncentral question. \nOur Commission did not believe the American witnesses and\nsaid so; neither did they believe the German witness, and they said so. In the\nreopening pleadings the testimony of the German witness is impugned by the\nclaimants and the point which the claimants really make is: Had the Commission\nat that time known to what extent the German witness had been untruthful, then\nthey would not have denied credence to the American witnesses with whom he\nwas in contradiction. This point is logically impeccable, as I always have\nadmitted; it makes the issue dependent on factual considerations which I always\nhave been ready to consider. \nInstead of this point you introduced a totally\ndifferent point (without being able by the way to substantiate it by any inter-\nnational or even municipal decision) which enables you to dispense with any\nfactual consideration at all : You assume that although the Commission denied\ncredence to the German witness they were still decisively influenced by the fact\nthat he came forward at all. And actually this consideration was for you the\ndecisive one regarding the question of the prima facie case which we were then\ndiscussing, for what other reasons you advanced for your attitude did not relate\nto the largest case before us, so that in this case the reason indicated was your\nonly reason.\nThe grave irregularity created by your procedure was twofold. \nFresh points\nintroduced in as late a stage as the deliberations of the Court after the Argument\nmake the other party defenseless. No opportunity is accorded to the defendants to\nshow what they have to say against your views, and they may have to say a great\ndeal.\nBut the other point is still of greater weight. I cannot shut my eyes to thefact\nthat in my opinion it is not compatible with the position of an Umpire and it shows\na bias if the Umpire makes points and bases his decisions on them which are not\nadvanced by the party [p. 1705] favored by them. The Umpire actually assumes\nby such a procedure the attitude of a legal adviser for the favored party and does\nso under circumstances under which the other side can no longer expect equal justice.\nThe grave situation with which I felt myself confronted (especially when all my\nattempts to show you what I have just explained were of no avail at all) made it\nmy duty to consider whether I could still cooperate in what was going on and what\nwas to my mind no longer a really judicial procedure. It was perfectly clear to me\nthat I was under a serious responsibility not to act hastily and to thoroughly con-\nsider the attitude which I had to take. But what accompanied the events described\nby me and what followed them in the next days only corroborated my original\nimpression. \nMy conviction that you had no longer an open mind deepened. \nI\ncould not overlook certain points as, for instance, this: A very fully substantiated\nfactual German argument on a certain point was discarded by you solely on the\nground that \" It merely was a clever piece of advocacy\"; when I insisted what\nyour reason was to discard it so summarily, you gave a factual reason which I could\nshow at once to be erroneous. \nInstead of now reconsidering your attitude, your\nanswer merely was in an impatient voice \" You may be quite sure that I do not\ncare in the least for all that.\" But this instance obviously was only a symptom.\n\nAPPENDICES \n495\nIt has become clear to me during these days that any argument advanced by the\nclaimants at once attracts your attention and evokes the idea, How could it be coi-\nroborated? Any argument advanced in favor of the defendants at once evokes\nin you the idea, How can it be refuted! As you told the American Commissioner\nand me, in many respects this case has been a disillusion to you and this has left\na strong emotional feeling with you. I cannot be but afraid that this emotional\nfeeling carries you away when I see to what extent the responsibility of German\nadvocates and witnesses is stressed by you whilst on the other [p. 1706] hand you\nfind no way to put in the balance what under the same heading may be alleged\nagainst the other side.\nThe result to which I have come is that it is impossible for me to cooperate in a\nprocedure which no longer offers to both parties equally the usual guarantees of a\ndecision arrived at in a really judicial way. Our charter allows any member of the\nCommission to retire and this is the consequence which I have drawn.\nFaithfully yours.\nDr. Victor L. F. H.

J., on July 29-30, 1916; the second, the fire at Kingsland, N. J.,\non January 11, 1917.\nIn these disasters millions of dollars worth of property was destroyed, and\nin the case of Black Tom, at least two lives were lost.\nThe Memorials of the United States were filed in March, 1927, and therefore\nthe cases have been pending before the Commission more than twelve years.\nThe present status of these claims is as follows: The American Agent on the\n4th day of May, 1933, filed a petition for rehearing and reconsideration of the\ndecision at Hamburg, dated the 16th day of October, 1930, on the ground\nthat it was induced by fraud and collusion on the part of witnesses and suppres-\nsion of evidence on the part of some of them. The purpose of the petition is\nfully set out in the following language in the decision of the Umpire at Wash-\nington, December 15, 1933 (Report of American Commissioner dated Decem-\nber 30, 1933, pp. 75, 76):\n\" Its allegations are that certain witnesses proffered by Germany furnished the\nCommission fraudulent, incomplete, collusive, and false evidence which misled the\nCommission and unfairly prejudiced the claimant's cases; that certain witnesses,\n\nDECISIONS \n239\nincluding some who previously testified, who are now within the United States,\nhave knowledge and can give evidence which will convince the Commission that\nits decision was erroneous; that evidence has come to light showing collusion\nbetween certain German and American witnesses to defeat the claims. These are\nserious allegations, and I express no opinion of the adequacy of the evidence ten-\ndered by the American Agent to sustain them. I have refrained from examining\nthe evidence because I thought it the proper course at this stage to decide the\nquestion of power on the assumption that the allegations of the petition may be\nsupported by proof, postponing for the consideration of the Commission the\nprobative value of the evidence tendered.\n\" The petition, in short, avers the Commission has been misled by fraud and collusion\non the part of witnesses and suppression of evidence on the part of some of them.\nThe Commission is not Junetus ofpeio. It still sits as a court. To it in that capacity\nare brought charges that it has been defrauded and misled by perjury, collusion,\nand suppression. No tribunal worthy its name or of any respect may allow its\ndecision to stand if such allegations are wellfounded. Every tribunal has inherent\npower to reopen and to revise a decision induced by fraud. If it may correct\nits own errors and mistakes, a fortiori it may, while it still has jurisdiction of a\ncause, correct errors into which it has been led by fraud and collusion.\n\" I am of opinion, therefore, that the Commission has power to reopen these cases,\nand should do so, in order that it may consider the further evidence tendered by\nthe American Agent and, dependent upon its findings from that evidence and any\nthat may be offered in reply on behalf of Germany, either confirm the decisions\nheretofore made or alter them as justice and right may demand.\"\nOn the 2nd day of May, 1935. the American Agent filed a Motion, asking\nthat an Order be entered\n\" to the effect that the Commission does not desire to take submission of these\nclaims until all evidence that either Government desires to have considered in\nsupport of or in opposition to the pending petition for rehearing has been filed\nin order that the Commission may, when it takes submission, enter an Order\nfinally disposing of these claims on their merits and that the Order further advise\nthe Agents of the two Governments accordingly.\"\nThe German Agent opposed the making of such an Order, and, in the decision\nof July 29, 1935, denying the Motion, the Commission, by the Umpire, said\n( P - 2 ) :\n\" By the petition and answer an issue was framed. This issue may be stated\nthus: ' Was the Commission misled by fraud practiced upon it? ' If that issue be\ndecided in favor of the claimants, the Commission should reopen the case upon\nthe merits and reexamine the conclusions reached in the light of the whole record,\nincluding the proofs offered to impeach evidence forming part of the record when\nits decision on the merits was rendered. Obviously the case is not reopened by the\npresentation of a petition praying for such action. Especially is this true where the\nallegations of the petition are categorically denied. This the American Agent\nconcedes. The decision of November 4, 1934 \\ so recognizes. It is there said:\n' The issue which will come before the Commission is made up by the allegations\nof the petition and the categorical denials of the answer.' \"\nIn the course of his opinion the Umpire also said (p. 3):\n\" * * * If the claimants prevail upon that preliminary question [the right to\nreopen]. the former decisions will be laid aside and the merits reexamined in the\nlight of all the evidence, including that tendered on the issue of fraud and\ncollusion. \n* * *\n\" It is, of course, conceivable that the Commission should hear argument on both\nthe propriety of reopening the case and the merits at one and the same time. Much\nmay be said pro and con such a procedure. Nevertheless, I suppose that if the\n1 Announced November 9, 1934.\n\n240 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\nparties were in agreement that this course should be followed, the Commission\nwould acquiesce. There is no such agreement. Germany insists that the pre-\nliminary question be determined separately. I am of opinion this is her right.\nShe now has a judgment. Before that judgment may be set aside and a new\nhearing held upon the merits, it is incumbent upon the claimants to sustain the\naffirmative of the issues made by their petition. The next hearing, therefore, will\nbe upon the question of reopening vel non, and not upon the merits.\"\nFollowing this decision, additional evidence and exhaustive briefs were filed\non behalf of each Government. Oral arguments were then had on May 12\nto 29, 1936. The Commission on June 3, 1936, handed down a unanimous\ndecision, setting aside the decision of December 3, 1932, and restoring the\nclaims to the position they were in before that decision was rendered. In the\ncourse of its decision the Commission said:\n\" Before the Hague Decision may be set aside the Commission must act upon the\nclaimant's petition for rehearing. Whether upon the showing made, the Com-\nmission should grant a rehearing, unless Germany shall agree to a different course, must,\nunder the Commission's decision of July 29, 1935, be determined by a hearing\nseparate from and distinct from any argument on the merits.\" (Emphasis sup-\nplied.)\nThat Germany, following the decision of June 3, 1936, did elect to follow\n\" a different course \", is evidenced by the fact that the German Agent exercised\nthe right given him in the Order of the Commission of December 1, 1937,\nreading as follows:\n\" that the German Agent may not only file the documents called for under Rule\n4 [of the Special Rules, under Order of March 20, 1929], b but may submit, if he\ndesires, further evidence.\"\nThe same Order provided that:\n\" The German Agent shall file with the Commission any other evidence [in\naddition to that called for under Rule 4] he desires to file on or before March 1,\n1938, and not thereafter.\"\nPursuant to this Order, the German Agent did file a considerable amount\nof evidence other than that called for under Rule 4 of the Special Rules, his\nlast evidence being filed on January 14, 1939.\nDuring the past twelve years, thousands of pages of evidence, consisting of\nofficial documents from the files of various Government Departments, affidavits,\nexaminations of witnesses under the Act of July 3, 1930 (46 Stat. 1005), and\nunder the act of June 7, 1933 (48 Stat. 117), and other instruments have been\nfiled and during that period, voluminous briefs were filed by each side and\nlengthy oral arguments heard, covering the various features of the cases.\nThe cases were closed on January 14, 1939, and each Agent has filed ex-\nhaustive briefs covering a full discussion, not only of the questions raised by the\npetition of May 4, 1933, but likewise arguing the cases on the merits. The\nAmerican Agent filed his briefs on September 13, and December 5, 1938. The\nGerman Agent filed his briefs on November 16, 1938, and January 12, and 14,\n1939. \nAfter exhaustive oral arguments by distinguished counsel extending\nthrough twelve days, the cases were finally submitted to the Commission on\nthe 27th day of January, 1939.\nAfter about two weeks had elapsed, the Umpire and the Commissioners\nbegan their conferences. These conferences continued, but not on consecutive\ndays, until Tuesday, February 28, 1939, when the last conference was held.\nb Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 244 infra.\n\nDECISIONS \n241\nAnother conference was scheduled to be held on Thursday, March 2, 1939,\nat the office of the Umpire. Shortly before the time for the conference, a letter\nfrom the German Commissioner, announcing his retirement, was delivered to\nthe Umpire and a similar letter was delivered to the American Commissioner.\nThese letters and the replies thereto have been made matters of record. 1\nThe subject of these conferences, in their early stages, was whether the evi-\ndence which had been adduced had proven fraud sufficient in character to\nset aside the decision at Hamburg.\nIn the course of these conferences, the American Commissioner expressed\nto the Umpire and to the German Commissioner his opinion that the decision\nat Hamburg had been reached on false and fraudulent evidence and that the\nproof of fraud was sufficient to set aside the Hamburg decision and reopen the\ncases.\nAfter the conferences had continued for a considerable time, the Umpire\nexpressed himself in entire agreement with the American Commissioner on the\nquestion of fraud. \nThereupon the German Commissioner argued that, if,\nupon an examination of the whole record, both before and subsequent to the\nHamburg decision, the Commission were to come to the conclusion that the\nUnited States had not proven its case, even though there had been fraud in the\nevidence before The Hague argument, it would be necessary to dismiss the\npetition, and he urged upon the Umpire and the American Commissioner the\nnecessity of considering the whole evidence for that purpose.\nIt was thereupon agreed that the whole record should be examined to deter-\nmine whether the American case had been proven or not, and it was while the\nCommission was engaged in examining this question that the letters aforesaid\nof the German Commissioner were received.\nAs was indicated clearly in the Umpire's reply, the letter to the Umpire\npresented a wholly false picture of the deliberations of the Commission. The\neffort of the German Commissioner to justify his retirement, by attributing bias\nto the Umpire, will receive, as it deserves, the disapprobation of every right-\nthinking person.\nCERTIFICATE OF DISAGREEMENT\nUnder these circumstances, I deem it my duty as American Commissioner\nto certify, and I do hereby certify, to the Umpire that, in both of the cases now\nunder consideration by the Commission, there was a disagreement between the\nAmerican Commissioner and the German Commissioner on all material points\nbefore the Commission, and particularly on the point as to whether the evidence\nwhich has been adduced had established fraud sufficient in character to justify\nthe Commission in setting aside the decision at Hamburg.\nI further certify that at the time when the German Commissioner retired, the\nCommission was, at his instance, considering the question whether the American\nAgent had proven his case, and, more particularly, whether the Herrmann\nmessage was an authentic instrument; and with this, my certificate, I am\nsubmitting my opinion with respect to said cases and the points of difference\ncertified, and I respectfully ask that this opinion be filed as a part of the record\nin this case.\nI. JURISDICTION\nThere have been spread upon the minutes of the Commission the letter of the\nGerman Commissioner, addressed to the Umpire, announcing his retirement\n1 For letters, see appendix. (Note by the Secretariat, this volume, Appendix V. p. 493.)\n\n242 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\nfrom the post of German Member of the Mixed Claims Commission; the Um-\npire's reply thereto; the letter of the German Commissioner to the American\nCommissioner apprizing him of his retirement ; the American Commissioner's\nreply thereto, and the letter of the American Commissioner to the Secretary\nof State, notifying the Secretary of State of the German Commissioner's retire-\nment and the status of this case at the time of the retirement of the German\nCommissioner.\nAlthough the German Commissioner announced his retirement on March 1,\n1939, and more than three months has expired, the German Government has\nfailed to follow the procedure prescribed by the Agreement of August 10, 1922,\nfor filling the vacancy.\nUnder the circumstances set out above and in the letters spread upon the\nminutes, the question which is now before the Commission for its decision is,\nwhether the Commission, acting through the Umpire and the American Com-\nmissioner, has the power to proceed with the cases and to decide whether the\nevidence which has been adduced has proven fraud sufficient in character to\nset aside the decision at Hamburg; and, second, whether upon an examination\nof the whole record, the American Agent has failed to prove his case.\nOr, to put the question in a different form, did the retirement of the German\nCommissioner on March, 1 1939, render the Commission functus qfficio and\ndeprive the Commission of the power to decide the questions at issue?\nIn order to examine and decide this question, it is necessary to refer to the\npertinent provisions of the Treaty of Berlin; the Agreement of August 10, 1922,\nbetween the two Governments, under which this Commission was organized,\nand the Rules of Procedure adopted by the Commission.\nUnder the Treaty of Berlin it was provided, in section 5, of the Joint Reso-\nlution of Congress, approved by the President July 2, 1921, 1 and incorporated\nin said Treaty, as follows:\n\" All property of the Imperial German Government, or its successor or succes-\nsors, and of all German nationals, which was, on April 6, 1917, in or has since\nthat date come into the possession or under control of, or has been the subject\nof a demand by the United States of America or of any of its officers, agents, or\nemployees, from any source or by any agency whatsoever, \n* * * shall be\nretained by the United States of America and no disposition thereof made, except\nas shall have been heretofore or specifically hereafter shall be provided by law\nuntil such time as the Imperial German Government \n* * * shall have\n* \n* * made suitable provision for the satisfaction of all claims against said\nGovernments respectively, of all persons, wheresoever domiciled, who owe perma-\nnent allegiance to the United States of America and who have suffered, through\nthe acts of the Imperial German Government, or its agents, \n* * * since\nJuly 31, 1914, loss, damage, or injury to their persons or property, directly or\nindirectly, \n* * * or in consequence of hostilities or of any operations of war,\nor otherwise.\"\nUnder the Agreement of August 10, 1922, between the United States and\nGermany, the preamble states that the two Governments,\n\" being desirous of determining the amount to be paid by Germany in satisfaction\nof Germany's financial obligations under the Treaty concluded by the two Govern-\nments on August 25, 1921, * * * have resolved to submit the questions for\ndecision to a mixed commission.\"\nArticle II of said Agreement reads as follows:\n\" The Government of the United States and the Government of Germany shall\neach appoint one commissioner. The two Governments shall by agreement select\n1 42 Stat. 105.\n\nDÉCISIONS \n243\nan umpire to decide upon any cases concerning which the commissioners may\ndisagree, or upon any points of difference that may arise in the course of their\nproceedings. Should the umpire or any of the commissioners die or retire, or be\nunable for any reason to discharge his functions, the same procedure shall be\nfollowed for filling the vacancy as was followed in appointing him.\"\nUnder this Agreement, the Mixed Claims Commission, United States and\nGermany, was constituted and was authorized to pass upon three categories\nof claims set out in said Agreement, and has decided many cases involving\nmillions of dollars.\nThe purpose for which the Commission was created is to determine the\namount to be paid by Germany in satisfaction of Germany's obligations under\nthe Treaty of Berlin to satisfy all claims against Germany of all persons who owe\npermanent allegiance to the United States and who have suffered through the\nacts of the Imperial German Government, or its agents, loss, damage, or\ninjury to their persons or property, directly or indirectly.\nAs indicated above, the German Commissioner retired on March 1, 1939,\nand although more than three months have expired, Germany has not followed\nthe procedure provided by the Agreement of August 10, 1922, for filling the\nvacancy.\nArticle VI of the Agreement of August 10, 1922, contains the following:\n\" The decisions of the commission and those of the umpire (in case there may\nbe any) shall be accepted as final and binding upon the two Governments.\"\nArticle VI (d) of the Rules of Procedure reads as follows :\n\" (d) When a case is submitted in pursuance of the foregoing provisions, the\nproceedings before the Commission in that case shall be deemed closed, unless\nopened by order of the Commission.\"\nArticle VIII, of the Rules of Procedure adopted by the Commission, reads\nas follows:\n\" DECISIONS\n\" (a) The two National Commissioners will certify in writing to the Umpire\nfor decision f 1) any case or cases concerning which the Commissioners may disagree,\nor (2) any point or points of difference that may arise in the course of their proceed-\nings, accompanied or supplemented by any statement in writing which either of\nthem may desire to make of his opinion with respect to the decision of the case or\ncases or point or points of difference certified.\n\" (b) The Umpire shall at all times have the right to the complete record in\nany and all cases and to hear oral argument in his discretion.\n\" (c) The Umpire may join with the two National Commissioners in announcing\n— or in the event of their disagreement certified to him shall announce — principles\nand rules of decision applicable to a group or groups of cases for the guidance as\nfar as applicable of the American Agent, the German Agent, and their respective\ncounsel, in the preparation and presentation of all claims.\n\" (d) All decisions shall be in writing and signed by (1) the Umpire and the\ntwo National Commissioners, or (2) by the two National Commissioners where\nthey are in agreement, or (3) by the Umpire alone when the two National Com-\nmissioners have certified their disagreement to him. Such decisions need not state\nthe grounds upon which they are based.\"\nOn March 20, 1929, the Commission entered an Order providing additional\nrules governing the sabotage cases, reading as follows (Report of the American\nAgent, 1934, p. 177):\n\" IT IS ORDERED BY THE COMMISSION that special additional rules\napplicable to this group of ' sabotage cases ' are adopted as follows:\n\n244 \nUNITED STATES/GERMAN Y\n\" (1) The Umpire will sit with the National Commissioners throughout the\nargument.\n\" (2) Each member of the Commission will carefully consider the entire record\nand the points and arguments put forward in the briefs whether the Agents and\ncounsel refer thereto in their oral arguments or not. This will enable counsel for\nboth sides to confine their arguments to those points which they believe to be most\nessential without incurring the risk of waiving a point not mentioned on the oral\nargument but considered relevant by any member of the Commission.\n\" (3) If any member of the Commission considers a point not orally argued one\nwhich should be taken into account in the Commission's decision, counsel's attention\nwill be called thereto during the progress of the argument or subsequent thereto,\nand counsel for both parties will be given an opportunity to discuss same on the\noral argument or t"}, {"id": "letter_thomsen", "title": "Letter from Thomsen (3 Oct 1939)", "content": "REPORTS OF INTERNATIONAL\nARBITRAL AWARDS\nRECUEIL DES SENTENCES\nARBITRALES\nMIXED CLAIMS COMMISSION UNITED STATES AND GERMANY: \nAppendices\nVIII\npp. 469-511\nVOLUME\nNATIONS UNIES - UNITED NATIONS\nCopyright (c) 2006\n\n500 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\n[German Chargé d'Affaires ad Interim to the Secretary of State]\n[Translation]\nGerman Embassy\nWashington, D. C.\nOctober 3, 1939\nMr. Secretary of State:\nBy direction of my Government I have the honor to make the following detailed\nstatements to Your Excellency, supplementing my note of July 11, 1939 l:\nIn the note of July 11. the German Government, through me, had protested to\nYour Excellency against certain acts in the proceedings before the German-American\nMixed Commission on the so-called Black Tom and Kingsland cases and had called\nthe attention of Your Excellency to the fact that measures for remedying [these\nmatters] are urgently [p. 1728] required. By direction of My Government I had\nalready protested most emphatically in this note against the decision of the American\nUmpire to grant awards in favor of the American and Canadian claimants, and also\nagainst all steps already taken and still to be taken by the American Agent for\nobtaining awards. At the same time I had requested Your Excellency to bring this\nprotest and the declaration of my Government, that any \"awards\" of the rump\nCommission are void, to the knowledge of the Secretary of the Treasury of the\nUnited States. Lastly I had announced in this note that I would take occasion in a\nfurther note to return to details of the above-mentioned violations of the rules of\nprocedure and all other serious irregularities which have occurred since March 1\nin the procedure of the Commission.\nAs Your Excellency advised me by the note of July 20, a copy of my note of\nJuly 11 was sent to the Treasury Department of the United States.\nThe present note is intended to serve the purpose announced and will discuss in\ndetail the violations of the rules of procedure in the proceedings continued before\nthe rump Commission. The German Government regrets all the more to have to\nmake protests against this procedure, because the German-American Mixed\nCommission could look back upon a model success in working, which had been\nmade possible by confidential and friendly collaboration of the members of the\nCommission and the two National Agents. It is characteristic of the spirit in which\nthe so-called Black Tom and Kingsland cases in particular were treated by the\nGerman Government that the claims of the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company\narising out of the explosion at the Black Tom Terminal, which Company was\nchiefly concerned, were admitted into the proceedings before the German-American\nMixed Commission only because [p. 1729] of voluntary admission by the German\nGovernment, after delay in submission. \nThe German Government could have\ndecisively excluded any discussion of these claims by referring to their delayed\nsubmission and the incompetence of the Commission arising therefrom. However,\nit did not pursue this course, but opened to the American Government and the\nAmerican parties concerned the possibility of submitting the claims to the Com-\nmission for investigation and decision, by agreeing to the admission of these claims\ninto the proceedings of the Commission, despite the delay in application, which\nwould not have been possible without its assent. The outcome was the decision of\nOctober 16, 1930, by which the Commission unanimously denied the claims arising\nout of the explosion at the Black Tom Terminal and also the claims arising out of the\nfire at the Kingsland factory.\nAccording to the agreement between the German Government and the United\nStates Government of August 10, 1922, this decision was to be accepted by both\nGovernments as final and binding. Despite this provision, however, the American\n1 Not part of Minutes of Commission.\n\nAPPENDICES \n501\nAgent submitted three applications in succession for reopening [of the cases], the\nfirst two of which were rejected by decisions of the Commission of March 30, 1931,\nand December 3, 1932. The third application for reopening, which was submitted\non May 4, 1933, formed the subject of the last proceedings. In these proceedings\nthere began the serious irregularities under discussion, which led to the withdrawal\nof the German Commissioner on March 1, 1939, and which finally reached their\nculmination in those measures against which the German Government found itself\ncompelled to protest most emphatically.\n1. The German Government sees the first violation of the basic agreements of\nthe two Governments and the Regulations on Procedure of the Commission in the\nfact that early in June 1939 the American Commissioner on his own motion drew\nup and published an order by which a \"session of the Commission\" was called for\nJune 15. As I have already [p. 1730] stated in my note of June 10 addressed to\nYour Excellency immediately after this measure became known, there was no legal\nbasis whatever for such a unilateral manner of action of the American Commissioner\nand for the holding of a \"session of the Commission\". Despite these protests, the\nAmerican Umpire and the American Commissioner, to whose knowledge my note\nhad been brought, held the \"session\" that was called and at this meeting issued a\n\"judgment\" and also a decision on questions of the greatest importance. At the\nconclusion of this \"session\", the American Umpire announced that the \"Com-\nmission\" would hold a further \"session\" for the issuance of \"awards\", notices of\nwhich would be sent out.\nAs previously in my notes of June 10 and July 11, 1939, I again consider myself\ncompelled now to call attention to the fact that during the vacancy in the position\nof the German Commissioner the Commission was incompetent to make a decision\nand therefore could not assemble for meetings either. The Commission is a mixed\nCommission; consequently decisions as to the holding of sessions and all other\ndecisions can be made only by collaboration of the two National Commissioners.\nThis self-evident principle has, in addition, been confirmed explicitly in the Agree-\nment of August 10, 1922, between the German Government and the United States\nGovernment, Article III of which reads as follows:\n\" They (the National Commissioners) may fix the time and place of their sub-\nsequent meetings according to convenience.\"\nAccording to this the American Commissioner and the American Umpire have\nno power and no right to call meetings of the Commission without the collaboration\nof the German Commissioner or to hold sessions at which measures concerning\nGermany are discussed, ordered or promulgated. The Agreement of August 10,\n1922 is the charter established for the Commission by the two governments, which\nis unalterable for the Commission. Under it, the Commission is composed of the\ntwo [p. 1731] National Commissioners, and the Agreement of August 10, 1922 gives\nthem the right to adjust the procedure and determine its course.\nIn order that no doubt may arise as to the view of the German Government, it is\nemphasized that in none of its communications has it taken the stand that by the\nwithdrawal of the German Commissioner the Commission has become \"functus\nofficio\" and has thereby lost its competence. \nThe withdrawal of the German\nCommissioner has, in the opinion of the German Government, not produced such\nan effect; the matters covered by the Agreement of August 10, 1922, which were\nbrought before the Commission in the proper way, within the framework of the\nagreements of the two Governments, belong, just as before, under its competence.\nThe sole conclusive question here is whether during the vacancy in the position of\nthe German Commissioner the American Commissioner, whether alone or jointly\nwith the American Umpire, can exercise functions which the governmental agree-\nment has entrusted to the two National Commissioners for joint exercise. Under\n33\n\n502 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\nthe Agreement of August 10, 1922, no such authority of the American Commissioner\nexists.\nBy direction of my Government I therefore protest most emphatically against\nthe holding of the further \"session of the Commission\" announced by the Umpire.\n2. No less illegal than the calling and holding of the \"session\" of June 15, 1939,\nwas the manner of action of the American Commissioner in the first matter which\nhe treated at this meeting with the American Umpire. He made public a summary\nof the letters which he himself and the American Umpire had exchanged early in\nMarch 1939 with the German Commissioner, who has withdrawn. On the basis\nof an order issued by him the text of these letters, copies of which he made available,\nwas reproduced in the report of the session. But not only was the text of the letters\nincluded in the records of the [p. 1732] Commission and in the report of the session,\nbut the American Commissioner embodied it also in subsequent written statements\nin which he attempted to prove the existence of a disagreement between himself and\nthe German Commissioner.\nThe correspondence thus employed by the American Commissioner concluded\nwith a letter of March 3 addressed by him to the German Commissioner, in which\nhe made the assertion that the stage of disagreement had already been reached in\nthe discussions of the Commission. \nThis enumeration and employment of the\ncorrespondence by the American Commissioner was bound to create the impression\nand doubtless was intended to do so, that the letters were reproduced in full and\nthat the German Commissioner had accepted, by maintaining silence, the above\nmentioned assertion of the American Commissioner.\nThe picture of the written exchange of opinions between the two National\nCommissioners which the American Commissioner in this way caused to appear in\nthe records and in his subsequent written statements was, however, incorrect.\nImmediately after the German Commissioner, [now] withdrawn, had received the\nletter of March 3 from the American Commissioner, he most decidedly contradicted\nthe assertion that he had dissented in the deliberations. In a letter to the American\nCommissioner written on that same day, a copy of which I sent to Your Excellency\non July 10, he set forth clearly and in detail those facts and opinions which showed\nthe incorrectness of the stand of the American Commissioner. Of special significance\non this point are the following statements in the reply of the German Commissioner\nto the American Commissioner, of March 3 :\n\" I surely reserved any decision of mine with respect to the question as to\nwhether the cases should be reopened or not. This was a necessary consequence\nof the point of view held by all three [p. 1733] of us, viz. that there could be no\nreopening, if the new decision on the old and new evidence taken together should\nbe identical in tenor with the Hamburg Decision.\n\" . . . I reserved also my decision with respect to the question as to whether\nthe Hamburg Decision had been reached upon false and fraudulent evidence.\nCertainly I put before you the doubts which might militate against such an assump-\ntion. But from reaching a decision about this point which might be considered\nas a definite agreement or disagreement I naturally refrained . . .\n\" I never should have formally disagreed on anything in this case without giving\na fully substantiated written opinion.\n\" How far we were from any agreement or disagreement may be best evidenced\nby the fact that none of us had even touched upon the subject of the nationality\nof the Canadian Car Agency, also you yourself will hardly entertain any doubt\nthat this question of jurisdiction or may be of the substance of the case would be\na part and topic of any decision.\"\nIt does not need to be emphasized that this letter was of decisive significance in\njudging of the question whether a disagreement between the national Commissioners\nexisted which would have justified the Umpire in taking up the questions brought\nbefore the Commission. The failure to place this letter of the German Commissioner\n\nAPPENDICES \n503\nin the records of proceedings and the written statements of the American Com-\nmissioner which the American Umpire accepted as his own, for collaboration in\nthe present cases, is an action which in itself alone stamps the proceedings conducted\nsince March 1 as irregular. Failure to make known the position of the German\nCommissioner in opposition to the unilateral declaration of the American Com-\nmissioner regarding the alleged disagreement deprives the subsequent acts of\nthe American Umpire of any legal basis and makes them void.\n3. The following acts contrary to the rules of procedure were connected with the\nincomplete submission of the correspondence discussed in the foregoing paragraph :\nAfter the American Commissioner had presented a document designated as a\n\"Certificate of Disagreement\" and a vote amounting to about 500 pages, signed by\nhim, the American Umpire read aloud a statement [p. 1734] designated as a\n\"decision\", in which he approved the American proposal of May 4, 1933, for\nreopening. At the same time the American Umpire made the vote of the American\nCommissioner, comprising 500 pages, a constituent part of his \"decision\" by citing it.\nI am instructed to call attention most emphatically to the fact that the cases in\nquestion were not at a stage in which the American Umpire had authority to make\na decision. His functions, as well as the conditions under which he is authorized and\ncalled upon to act, are exactly circumscribed and delimited in the Agreement of\nAugust 10, 1922, as well as in the Rules for Procedure of the Commission, established\nby joint agreement.\nArticle II of the Agreement provides:\n\" The two Governments shall by agreement select an Umpire to decide upon\nany cases concerning which the Commissioners may disagree or upon any points\nof difference that may arise in the course of their proceedings.\"\nIn the Rules of Procedure the following is prescribed:\n\" VIII. (a) The two national commissioners will certify in writing to the Umpire\nfor decision (1) any case or cases concerning which the Commissioners may\ndisagree or (2) any point or points of difference that may arise in the course of\ntheir proceedings, accompanied or supplemented by any statement in writing which\neither of them may desire to make of his opinion with respect to the decision of\nthe case or cases or point or points of difference certified.\"\nIt is thus made clear in a form excluding any doubt that the Umpire may move\nto a decision only if two prerequisites are fulfilled, viz. :\n1. A formal \ndisagreement of the two National Commissioners on the controversial\nquestion submitted to them for opinion or decision must exist.\n2. Both National Commissioners must have certified this disagreement in written\nform.\nNeither of these two conditions existed in the present case. [p. 1735]\n[Comment] on 1. A disagreement of the National Commissioners in the sense of the\nprovisions of the Agreement of August 10, 1922 did not exist either with respect to\nsubstance or form. The status of the deliberations at the time of the withdrawal of\nthe German Commissioner is evidenced by a letter which the American Com-\nmissioner addressed to Your Excellency on March 3, 1939, and in which he made\nthe following statement:\n\" . . . We thereupon proceeded to examine the whole record to determine from\nthat record whether the American case had been proven. It was while the Com-\nmission was engaged in examining this question that Dr. Huecking's action in\nregard to his retirement was taken.\"\nIn connection with the statements which Dr. Huecking makes in his letter of\nMarch 3, withheld by the American Commissioner, the statement of the American\n\n504 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\nCommissioner shows plainly that the deliberations of the Commission had not yet\nled to a disagreement. Hence there was absolutely no factual basis for the assertion\nmade in the \"decision\" of the Umpire: \"Within the meaning and intent of this\nagreement.. . there exists a disagreement between the two National Commissioners.\"\n[Comment] on 2. There was never submitted to the American Umpire a written\ncertificate of disagreement prepared by the two National Commissioners. He had\nbefore him merely a document prepared and signed by the American Commissioner\nby himself, to which there was annexed a so-called vote of the American Com-\nmissioner. Of course, such a document is not a certificate in the sense of the Rules\nof Procedure cited above.\n4. The content of the \"decision\" of the American Umpire and the American\nCommissioner gives reason for the most serious representations. It provides in a\nstriking way a confirmation of the events which led the German Commissioner to\nwithdraw.\nThe German Commissioner made use of the right of withdrawal which is open to\nthe Members of international commissions at any time, and moreover is also\nexpressly provided in Article II of the Agreement [p. 1736] of August 10, 1922,\nwhen during the course of the deliberations it became more and more evident to\nhim that the American Umpire was most strongly biased in favor of the American\nprivate parties concerned and against Germany. Two phases of the deliberations\nin which this prejudiced view was shown with special clearness were characterized\nas follows by the German Commissioner in his letLer to the American Umpire, of\nMarch 1, 1939:\n\" . . . In respect to the latest of our claims you introduced as your main point\na point which was not made by the claimants at all and which, as far as I am\naware, never was argued . . . I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that in my opinion\nit is not compatible with the position of an umpire and it shows a bias if the Umpire\nmakes points and bases his decisions on them which are not advanced by the party\nfavored by them. The Umpire actually assumes by such a procedure the attitude\nof a legal adviser for the favored party and does so under circumstances under\nwhich the other side can no longer expect equal justice.\n\" . . . It has become clear to me during these days that any argument advanced\nby the claimants at once attracts your attention and evokes the idea, How could\nit be collaborated? \nAnd any argument advanced in favor of the defendants at\nonce evokes in you the idea, How can it be refuted? \"\nThe German Commissioner supplemented this remark with the depiction of the\nbehavior of the American Umpire during the discussion of certain concrete portions\nof the matter in the case and concluded his letter with the statement:\n\" The result to which I have come is that it is impossible for me to cooperate\nin a procedure which no longer offers to both parties equally the usual guarantee\nof a decision arrived at in a really judicial way.\"\nThis statement carries all the more weight as the American Umpire could find\nonly the following answer to the letter of the German Commissioner of March 1,\nwhich, as shown, did not contain any accusations kept on a general plane, but\ndescribed in detail concrete occurrences in the deliberations: [p. 1737]\n\" I do not propose to enter into any controversy with respect to the statements\ncontained in your letter other than to say that they are unjustified and, in my\nopinion, present a wholly false picture of our deliberations.\"\nThe \"decision\" of the American Umpire and the American Commissioner of\nJune 15 affords clear proof for the statements of the German Commissioner. Cha-\nracteristic of this is in itself the fact that the American Umpire did not discuss the\nfacts in the case exhaustively in his own remarks, as he had done in his earlier\ndecisions, but himself wrote a \"decision\" containing only a few paragraphs, but\n\nAPPENDICES \n505\nfor the rest accepted the vote of the American Commissioner and made it the\nsubstance of his decision. Even a hasty examination of the \"decision\" thus made\nup discloses the character of a document in which the German Government is\nviewed and treated as an opponent in litigation. \nThis attitude is characterized\nwith special clearness by the appearance in a considerable number of places of\nexpressions such as \"We have proven\" and \"We have shown\", which do not\nindicate the deliberations of a judge but are entirely natural for an advocate who\nsees it as his duty to prove his case against his opponent. In addition it must also\nbe brought out that in astonishingly numerous places the evidence arguing in favor\nof Germany is represented as unessential or is made light of, while simple statements\nmade by the American Agent against Germany are not only accepted without\nreserve, but their significance is even emphasized. Further, innumerable are the\nplaces at which statements of witnesses of the American Government are sustained\nin the \"decision\" without criticism as entirely conclusive and true, while German\ncounter-proofs and German assertions against material of this sort are treated as\nnonexistent.\nIn this connection the treatment of the statement of an expert witness of the\ncomplainants, who designated the disputed \"Herrmann report\" as a genuine\ndocument, deserves special mention. On the German [p. 173B] side reference had\nbeen made to material contained in the record, which plainly refuted the conclusions of\nthis expert. This German declaration was not only left unmentioned by the rump\nCommission in its \"decision\", but it cited instead, in order to show the witness to\nbe dependable and qualified, alleged pieces of evidence, which had not been\nmentioned in the case at all, and therefore did not belong to the material in the\ncase, and hence must have been brought to the knowledge of the American Umpire\nand the American Commissioner subsequently and outside the proceedings.\nA further evidently wrong conclusion of the Umpire refers to the thesis upon\nwhich the \"decision\" of the rump Commission is founded, viz. that the Black Tom\ncase and the Kingsland case arc proven if the so-called \"Herrmann report\" is genuine.\nOn this point the American Umpire merely states in the \"decision\" that this con-\nsequence is admitted. The German Agent, by whom alone such an admission could\nbe made, has never made such a statement. On the contrary, when the \"Herrmann\nreport\" was discussed before the Commission for the first time, it was explicitly\ndeclared by the German Agent that the \"report\" would not prove the allegation\nof the complainants even if it were genuine, which was not the case. In the written\nstatement submitted by the German Agent in preparation for the last verbal\ndiscussion, it was also specially brought out that every assertion of the American\nAgent is opposed by Germany unless its correctness is explicitly admitted.\nThe German Government is further compelled to point out with all emphasis that\nthe American Umpire has shown a complete reversal of his opinion in the judgment\non the \"Herrmann report\", considered by him so important, in so far as its intrinsic\nvalue as evidence is concerned. \nWhen the American Umpire investigated the\n[p. 1739] question of the genuineness of the \"Herrmann report\" in 1932 and decided\non it, he designated the contradictory statements of the witnesses and experts of the\ntwo parties as irlconclusive. In contrast to this, he placed decisive weight on the\nintrinsic value of the document itself as evidence. \nThe result of his exhaustive\ninvestigation and judgment of this intrinsic value as evidence, the naming of persons\nand places and the depiction of current and past events in the report, was summa-\nrized as follows by the American umpire in the decision of December 3, 1932:\n\" But enough has been said to show in how extraordinary a manner this docu-\nment dovetails with all the important and disputed points of claimant's case and\nhow pat all these references are, not to the request for funds but to the claimants'\npoints of proof—this aside from the absurdity of sending this unnecessary infor-\nmation into an enemy country to a suspected spy then under surveillance.\"\n\n506 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\nAfter the Umpire had considered two further suspicious but less important\nfactors, he closed his judgment on the \"Herrmann report\" with the statement:\n\" . . The silent but persuasive intrinsic evidence makes it impossible to reach a con-\nclusion in favor of the claimants and against Germany.\"\nThese statements of the Umpire, independent of any biased allegations and of\nexternal evidence, were bound also to remain unalterable for the whole future, just\nas the content of the document upon which they were based remained unalterable.\nThe difficulty arising out of this with respect to the overthrowing of his own\ndecision was pushed aside by the American Umpire with the simple statement that\nfurther study had converted him to the opinion that the intrinsic evidence confirmed\nthe genuineness of the \"Herrmann report\". \nWhat he had called \"absurd\" in\nDecember 1932 was now illuminating; what he had then designated as impossible,\nincredible and improbable now became convincing, credible and explicable.\nWithout going into detail as to the points on which his earlier decision on the\nintrinsic evidence of the \"Herrmann report\", the reasons for which [p. 1740] were\ngiven in such conclusive form, had now proved to be faulty, he states in a few words\nthat the renewed argument and a further exhaustive study of the content of the\nreport (which, according to the explicit statement in his 1932 decision, he had\nalready investigated and evaluated most thoroughly at that time) as well as further\nstudy of the statements of two witnesses and of the records as they existed at the time\nof the Hague pleadings, (again material which the Umpire had investigated most\nthoroughly prior to the decision of December 3, 1932) had led to this reversal of his\nopinion.\nThese facts speak more strongly than any criticism can do.\n5. How little disposed the American Umpire was to concern himself with the\nGerman evidence and how he placed himself above recognized principles of inter-\nnational law and also above the firmly grounded practice of the Commission with\nrespect to decisions, is shown by the treatment of the case of the Agency of Canadian\nCar and Foundry Company, which was chiefly concerned in the Kingsland case.\nIt was absolutely clear to the Commission that all of the shares of stock of this\nconcern, which had been inactive for many years, belonged to a Canadian cor-\nporation domiciled in Montreal, and that consequently the claims of this com-\nplainant were made exclusively for the benefit of Canadian interests. According\nto practice supported by several decisions of the Commission, the claims of the\nAgency of Canadian Car and Foundry Company did not come within its jurisdiction\nat all. Although the Commission is to view this view in and of itself (sua sponte),\nthe German Agent had also submitted a formal proposal in which he asked that the\napplication for reopening of the case submitted for the benefit of the Canadian\ninterests be rejected a limine in view of their lack of American nationality. A few\ndays before the [p. 1741] beginning of the oral final arguments, the German Agent\nsubmitted also a printed statement giving the reasons in detail for this stand.\nLastly, the German Commissioner, in his letter of March 3, 1939, withheld by the\nAmerican Commissioner, pointed out the fact that the question of nationality of the\ncomplainant Canadian company belonged among those points which the Com-\nmission would have to investigate before the promulgation of a decision. It has\nbecome known to the German Government that American companies which are\nholders of older awards have requested the United States Government to refuse its\nprotection to the Canadian claims and that they were informed that the question\nof handling the claims of the Agency of Canadian Car and Foundry Company would\nhave to be decided by the Commission.\nThe American Umpire and the American Commissioner, however, did not\nexpress themselves at all on this question, which is decisive with regard to claims to\n\nAPPENDICES \n507\nseveral million dollars, and they did not even find it necessary to mention the\nexistence of the opposition raised by the German Government.\nThe German Government finds itself compelled to enter a most emphatic protest\nagainst this also. The approval of claims of Canadian interested parties in a procedure\nwhich the German Government and the United States Government have established\nfor the settlement of claims of American citizens is null and void.\n6. In the last arguments before the Commission, the procedure was limited\nstrictly to the preliminary question of the alleged misleading of the Commission, as\nhad been maintained by the American Agent. Hence the German Agent refrained\nat this stage of the proceedings from taking any stand on that point and refrained\nfrom the submission of counter evidence on all points which in his opinion were\nirrelevant to the preliminary question of \"misleading\", and without regard to the\nquestion of whether they would be of essential importance in case of a possible\nreopening of the proceedings on the main question, that is on the responsibility of\nGermany. He was able to follow this course with [p. 1742] all the less hesitation,\nas it corresponded to the principles which the Umpire had established in a decision\nof November 9, 1934. The German Agent also explicitly invoked these conside-\nrations, determining his behavior, in explaining his action in the case.\nIf the Commission, in opposition to the opinion of the German Agent, considered\nas essential a point which he held to be unessential and did not discuss in his written\nstatements or his arguments, it should have called his attention to that fact and\nshould have called on him for a statement with respect thereto. This duty arising\nout of general rules of procedure was explicitly laid down in the Regulations on\nProcedure, which the Commission established for the proceedings in the Black Tom\nand Kingsland cases in its order of March 29, 1929, and which, in view of the tens\nof thousands of pages of material in the cases, were intended to prevent the possibility\nof conclusions being drawn, to the disadvantage of one party, from failure to discuss\nsingle phases of this enormous amount of evidence. The essential provisions of\nthe Order of the Commission of March 29, 1929 (Rule III) reads as follows:\n\" If any member of the Commission considers a point not orally argued one\nwhich should be taken into account in the Commission's decision, counsel's attention\nwill be called thereto during the progress of the argument or subsequent thereto,\nand counsel for both parties will be given an opportunity to discuss same on the\noral argument or to file written or printed briefs within a time to be fixed by the\nCommission covering such particular point or points.\"\nNot only have the American Umpire and the American Commissioner disregarded\nthis binding rule of procedure, but they have also made the statement at various\nplaces in their \" decision \" that the German Agent had not expressed himself regard-\nding assertions of the American Agent. Important conclusions are drawn in the\n\"decision\", to the disadvantage of Germany, from this alleged silence, [p. 1743]\n7. The violations of procedure stated in the foregoing reached their culmination\nin the occurrences following the reading aloud of the \"decision\", to illustrate which\nI should like to make the following preliminary remarks on the state of the pro-\nceedings at that time:\nAs I have already brought out once, the proceedings were strictly limited to the\npreliminary question of whether the Commission should revoke the unanimous\ndecision of October 16, 1930, rejecting the complaints in full, and should grant\nreopening of the proceedings. \nThe material question of the justification of the\nclaims, which is entirely separate from the preliminary question of a possible\nreopening, had been postponed and could be decided, if at all, only after carrying\nout of the procedure after reopening. This plain method of procedure, established\nby the Commission itself, thus presupposed a decision on the proposal for reopening\nthe proceedings. Not until after a possible pronouncement of a favorable decision\n\n508 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\ncould and should the main question be entered upon in the proceedings, and not\nuntil after the conclusion of these proceedings could the question of the responsibility\nof Germany have been submitted to the two National Commissioners for decision\nand, in case of a possible disagreement of the Commissioners, to the Umpire for\nthe granting of an award. Any proceedings that might have become necessary\nrespecting the amount of the damage allegedly caused, the method of proving this\nand the proof of any financial claims of the complainants arising therefrom would\nhave been reserved for a still further stage in the proceedings. In the correspondence\nexchanged in the years 1927 and 1928 the fully empowered representatives of both\nGovernments had agreed that this last set of questions should be taken up only in\ncase the Commission should decide that Germany was responsible in one of the two\ncases or both of them, and not until then. As a matter of course, Germany and the\nUnited States [p. 1744] would have the right to submit evidence and written state-\nments in the proceedings, if any, regarding the alleged responsibility of Germany\nand in any further proceedings as to the amount of the claims, and also to demand\noral arguments thereon if necessary. In the expectation that the American Agent\nand also the Commission would observe this agreement faithfully, the German\nAgent had not taken any stand with respect to the American evidence on the\namount of damage and had not introduced opposing evidence of any kind.\nThe Commission itself has made plain this legal situation in unmistakable form\nin two decisions which it issued in order to establish directions for the two National\nAgents regarding the scope and the form of the action taken by them in the written\nas well as the oral proceedings. When in 1935 the American Agent adopted the\nsurprising view that the next decision of the Commission ought to cover both the\npreliminary question of reopening and also the question of the responsibility of\nGermany, the Umpire stated in a decision of July 29, 1935;\n\" . . . The first step is the determination whether the claimants' assertions as to\nfraud, et cetera, are made out . . . The relevancy and weight of evidence upon\nthe comparatively narrow issue made by the petition and answer will be one thing;\nthe relevancy and weight of evidence upon the merits if a rehearing be granted\nwill be quite an different thing . . . Germany insists that the preliminary question\nbe determined separately. \nI am of the opinion that is her right. \nThe next hearing,\ntherefore, will be upon the question of reopening vel non and not upon the merits.\"\nA second time the Commission confirmed this legal status in the unanimous\ndecision of June 3, 1936, in which it declared:\n\" . . . Before the Hague Decision may be set aside the Commission must act upon\nthe claimants' petition for rehearing. \nWhether upon the showing made, the\nCommission should grant a rehearing, unless Germany shall agree to a different\ncourse, must, under the Commission's Decision of July 29, 1935, be determined\nby a hearing separate from and distinct from any argument on the merits. Both\nparties are entitled to file evidence (and to exchange briefs) as are in the proceedings in which\na ruling for reopening is sought as in the subsequent proceedings dealing with the merits,\nshould such a ruling be granted.1' \n[p. 1745]\nIt could not in fact be made clearer that on the basis of the oral arguments then\nin prospect, which took place in January 1939, a decision could and would not be\nissued on any other question than the justification or non-justification of the Ameri-\ncan Agent's motion for reopening.\nIn spite of this unambiguous legal situation, the American Agent made the plea\nat the \" session \" of the rump Commission that awards be granted in favor of the\nprivate interests concerned. As this demand involved the question of the respon-\nsibility of Germany and the question of the amount of the damages allegedly arising,\nthe Commission (assuming that it was capable at all of making a decision) would\ncertainly have had to reject the application of the American Agent, in accordance\nwith its decisions cited above, binding upon itself and the Agents of the two Govern-\n\nAPPENDICES \n509\nments. However, the American Umpire took the absolutely unjustifiable step of\napproving the petition forthwith, by declaring:\n\" In view of what appears in the record, and based upon the American Agent's\nmotion, the Commission is prepared to sign awards, to be submitted by the Amer-\nican Agent, if approved by the Commission as to form. Those may be submitted,\nand if approved will be made at a further meeting to be called on notice.\"\nAs I have already stated in my note of July 11, 1939, this method of procedure\nis an event without parallel in the history of international commissions and courts.\nWithout hesitating even for a moment (not a single minute had elapsed since the\nmaking of the motion), the American Umpire decided, leaving out of consideration\nentirely the guarantees given to Germany by himself and the Commission, on\nextremely important questions, which had never been the subject of proceedings and had never\nbeen submitted to the Commission for decision by the two National Agents. \nIn this connection\nit must be taken into consideration that the Umpire himself in a decision of Decem-\nber 15, 1933 on the cases in question, had declared that in view of the completion\n[p. 1746] of the arguments of the National Agents the Commission by no means had\nthe freedom of action of ordinary courts and could not decide a disputed case unless\nboth Agents had given their agreement thereto by written statements. He said at\nthat time:\n\" The Commission has from its inception been sensible of its lack of power to\ncompel the closing of the record and the final submission of any case . . . \nIt has\nnever, as I am advised, entered an order for the final closing of the record in any\ncase without consent or over objection. / do not think it has power to do so.\"\nPlain language is also used in the order of the American Umpire that the American\nAgent should submit the awards \" for signing by the Commission \". The Agreement\nof August 10, 1922, does not present the slightest ground for the authority to transfer\nunilaterally to the Agent of one party such important functions, which are ex-\nclusively the business of the two National Commissioners. As the German Agent,\ntrusting, in the Agreement made with the American Agent in the years 1927 and\n1928, had failed entirely to take any stand with regard to the amount of the alleged\ndamages or to submit counter-proof, the action of the American Umpire means that\nthe measurement of the amount of damage and of the claims is based entirely upon\nthe allegations in the case and the evidence which the lawyers of the American and\nCanadian private parties have assembled, who are most keenly concerned in the\nfixing of the highest possible amounts of damage.\nThis method of action of the American Umpire, contrary to the rules and in\ncontradiction to any idea of a judicial decision, reaches its culmination in his\nannouncement that the \" Commission \" will sign the awards, if they have been\napproved by the \" Commission \" as to form. (\" The Commission is prepared to sign\nawards to be submitted by the American Agent, if approved by the Commission\nas to form.\") \nThe statement made by the American Umpire shows clearly that\ninvestigation of the sums of damages established unilaterally by the complaining\nparty and without possibility of opposition, would refer only to [p. 1747] certain\nrequirements as to outer form, but not to the material establishment of the amount\nof damages—and this in a litigation between two sovereign Governments, in which\nthe uninvestigated claims amount to approximately $40,000,000 !\nThe statement of reasons for the decision of the American Umpire, that he was\nacting \"in view of what appears in the record\" and was taking as a basis \"the\nmotion of the American Agent\" (\"In view of what appears in the record and based\nupon the American Agent's motion\"), is adapted only to emphasize the arbitrary\ncharacter of his action. Not one single fact is contained in the record which could\nform a basis for his decision above. As far as the motion of the American Agent\nthat is referred to is concerned, the latter was restricted to the following unsub-\nstantiated assertion:\n\n510 \nUNITED STATES/GERMANY\n\" . . . In view of the attitude of Germany, as expressed in the communications\nbetween the German Commissioner and the Umpire and the American Commissioner,\nand the communication between the German Embassy and the Secretary of State\nof the United States, it is apparent that Germany does not intend to take any\nfurther part in the proceedings before this Commission, and seeks to avoid a final\nconclusion, and frustrate the work of the Commission.\"\nIt is evident from this that the American Umpire based decisions of the very\ngreatest importance not upon facts according to the record but contented himself\nwith one-sided partisan assertions which represented an arbitrary evaluation and\ninterpretation by the American Agent of my note of June 10, 1939, addressed to\nYour Excellency and the two letters of the German Commissioner of March 1st.\nIt does not need to be explained that such evaluations and interpretations cannot\nserve as the basis for an important motion in a case or in fact for a decision, entirely\naside from the fact that the communications of the withdrawing German Com-\nmissioner were not submitted in full at the \" session \" of the rump Commission, the\nspecially [p. 1748] significant letter of March 3, 1939, being omitted, and were\nentered in the record of the session in that form. The interpretation which the\nAmerican Agent gave to the statements in my note to Your Excellency of June 10,\n1939, and to the written remarks of the German Commissioner was in every respect\nbaseless and arbitrary; the documents do not contain a single word that might\njustify his assertions.\nThe American Umpire has and had no authority at all to concern himself with\nthe motion to grant awards. As I have had occasion to remark repeatedly, the\nstatute of the Commission establishes the principle that the discussion and in-\nvestigation of all matters brought before it is in the first place exclusively the business\nof the two National Commissioners. They compose the Commission. The Umpire\ncan act only under certain fully defined conditions, and his duty is strictly limited\n\" to deciding on all cases in which the Commissioners might be of differing opinions.\"\nThe motion of the American Agent asking for the issuance of awards was not\ndiscussed by both Commissioners at any stage of the procedure before the Commis-\nsion nor was it the subject of an exchange of opinions between the Commissioners.\nTherefore there is not the remotest possibility of speaking of the occurrence of a\ndisagreement of the National Commissioners, which is an indispensable prerequisite\nfor the Umpire to concern himself with the matter and make a decision. \nThe\ndecision made by the American Umpire on this question is a function which he\nusurped in violation of the statute of the Commission.\nTo sum up, it appears therefore that the \"decision\" of the American Umpire,\nwhich contemplates the issuance of awards, was issued in disregard and violation\nof essential provisions of the statute of the Commission, essential agreements be-\ntween the German Government and the United States Government, essential rules\nof procedure and binding decisions of the full Commission, the observance of which\nwould have been the absolute duty of the American Umpire. (The Agreement\nbetween the two governments of August 10, 1922; the Rules of Procedure [p. 1749]\nestablished jointly; the Decisions of the Commission of July 29, 1935 and July 3,\n1936, as well as the agreement of the Agents of the two Governments of the years\n1927 and 1928 on the treatment of the question of the amount of alleged damages.)\nAccordingly the acts and orders of the American Umpire and the American\nCommissioner since March 1, 1939, among them the reopening of the proceedings\nin the Black Tom and Kingsland cases, the \" decision \" of the Umpire and the\nAmerican Commissioner on the responsibility of Germany in both cases, and the\narbitrary granting of awards by the American Umpire, are null and void. Any\nawards which the American Umpire and the American Commissioner might issue\non the basis of these measures are likewise null and void. They can never form the\nbasis for a financial obligation of Germany. A document which has been drawn up\n\nAPPENDICES \n511\nwithout any collaboration of the German Commissioner can, besides, never be\nconsidered or accepted as an award of the \"Mixed Commission\".\nBy direction of my Government I therefore raise once more the most emphatic\nrepresentations against all violations of the rules of procedure and illegal acts of the\nAmerican Umpire disclosed in this note. I am directed to protest against all further\nmeasures planned by the American Umpire, the American Commissioner and the\nAmerican Agent, which are aimed at securing awards in the Black Tom and Kings-\nland cases. I request Your Excellency to advise the Treasury Department of the\nUnited States, upon which the payment of awards is incumbent, of the contents of\nthis note, and I should be grateful if one copy of this note were also sent to the\nAmerican Umpire and one to the American Commissioner.\nBy direction of my Government, I should like to express the hope that the United\nStates Government does not approve of the violations of procedure discussed in this\nnote and that it will find some way of quashing them, in order to restore, in colla-\nboration with [p. 1750] the German Government, the basis existing before the\nbeginning of these violations of procedure, upon which the proceedings can be\nbrought to a conclusion in an orderly way.\nAccept, Mr. Secretary of State, the renewed assurance of my most distinguished\nconsideration.\nTHOMSEN\nHis Excellency\nMr. Cordell HULL,\nSecretary of State of the United States,\nWashington, D.

These LCIA Rules comprise this Preamble, the Articles and the Index, together with the Annex to the LCIA Rules and the Schedule of Costs as both from time to time may be separately amended by the LCIA (the \"LCIA Rules\").\n\nARTICLE 1 - REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION\n\n1.1 Any party wishing to commence arbitration under the LCIA Rules (the \"Claimant\") shall deliver to the Registrar of the LCIA Court (the \"Registrar\") a written request for arbitration (the \"Request\"), containing or accompanied by:\n\n(i) the full name, nationality and all contact details (including email address, postal address and telephone number) of the Claimant for the purpose of receiving delivery of all documentation in the arbitration in accordance with Article 4; and the same particulars of the Claimant's authorised representatives (if any) and of all other parties to the arbitration;\n\n(ii) the full terms of the Arbitration Agreement (excepting the LCIA Rules) invoked by the Claimant to support its claim, together with a copy of any contractual or other documentation in which those terms are contained and to which the Claimant's claim relates;\n\n(iii) a statement briefly summarising the nature and circumstances of the dispute, its estimated monetary amount or value, the transaction(s) at issue and the claim advanced by the Claimant against any other party to the arbitration (each such other party being here separately described as a \"Respondent\");\n\n(iv) a statement of any procedural matters for the arbitration (such as the arbitral seat, the language(s) of the arbitration, the number of arbitrators, their qualifications and identities) upon which the parties have already agreed in writing or in respect of which the Claimant makes any proposal under the Arbitration Agreement;\n\n(v) if the Arbitration Agreement (or any other written agreement) howsoever calls for any form of party nomination of arbitrators, the full name, email address, postal address and telephone number of the Claimant's nominee;\n\n(vi) confirmation that the registration fee prescribed in the Schedule of Costs has been or is being paid to the LCIA, without actual receipt of which the Request shall be treated by the Registrar as not having been delivered and the arbitration as not having been commenced under the Arbitration Agreement; and\n\n(vii) confirmation that copies of the Request (including all accompanying documents) have been or are being delivered to all other parties to the arbitration in accordance with Article 4 by one or more means to be identified specifically in such confirmation, to be supported then or as soon as possible thereafter by documentary proof satisfactory to the LCIA Court of actual delivery (including the date of delivery) or, if actual delivery is demonstrated to be impossible to the LCIA Court's satisfaction, sufficient information as to any other effective form of notification.\n\n1.2 A Claimant wishing to commence more than one arbitration under the LCIA Rules (whether against one or more Respondents and under one or more Arbitration Agreements) may serve a composite Request in respect of all such arbitrations, provided that the requirements of Article 1.1 are complied with to the satisfaction of the LCIA Court in respect of each arbitration. In particular, in any composite Request the Claimant must identify separately the estimated monetary amount or value in dispute, the transaction(s) at issue and the claim advanced by the Claimant against any other party in each arbitration. Each arbitration so commenced shall proceed separately and in accordance with the LCIA Rules, subject to the LCIA Court or the Arbitral Tribunal determining otherwise.\n\n1.3 The Request (including all accompanying documents) shall be submitted to the Registrar in electronic form in accordance with Article 4.1.\n\n1.4 The arbitration shall be treated as having commenced for all purposes on the date upon which the Request (including all accompanying documents) is received electronically by the Registrar (the \"Commencement Date\"), provided that the LCIA has received the registration fee. Where the registration fee is received subsequently the Commencement Date will be the date of the LCIA's actual receipt of the registration fee.\n\n1.5 At any time after the Commencement Date but prior to the appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal the LCIA Court may allow a Claimant to supplement, modify or amend its Request to correct any error in computation, any clerical or typographical error, any ambiguity or any mistake of a similar nature, after giving the parties a reasonable opportunity to state their views and upon such terms as the LCIA Court may decide.\n\n1.6 There may be one or more Claimants (whether or not jointly represented); and in such event, where appropriate, the term \"Claimant\" shall be so interpreted under the Arbitration Agreement.\n\nARTICLE 2 - RESPONSE\n\n2.1 Within 28 days of the Commencement Date, or such lesser or greater period to be determined by the LCIA Court upon application by any party or upon its own initiative (pursuant to Article 22.5), the Respondent shall deliver to the Registrar a written response to the Request (the \"Response\"), containing or accompanied by:\n\n(i) the Respondent's full name, nationality and all contact details (including email address, postal address and telephone number) for the purpose of receiving delivery of all documentation in the arbitration in accordance with Article 4 and the same particulars of its authorised representatives (if any);\n\n(ii) confirmation or denial of all or part of the claim advanced by the Claimant in the Request, including the Claimant's invocation of the Arbitration Agreement in support of its claim;\n\n(iii) if not full confirmation, a statement briefly summarising the nature and circumstances of the dispute, its estimated monetary amount or value, the transaction(s) at issue and the defence advanced by the Respondent, and also indicating any counterclaim advanced by the Respondent against any Claimant and any cross-claim against any other Respondent;\n\n(iv) a response to any statement of procedural matters for the arbitration contained in the Request under Article 1.1(iv), including the Respondent's own statement relating to the arbitral seat, the language(s) of the arbitration, the number of arbitrators, their qualifications and identities and any other procedural matter upon which the parties have already agreed in writing or in respect of which the Respondent makes any proposal under the Arbitration Agreement;\n\n(v) if the Arbitration Agreement (or any other written agreement) howsoever calls for party nomination of arbitrators, the full name, email address, postal address and telephone number of the Respondent's nominee; and\n\n(vi) confirmation that copies of the Response (including all accompanying documents) have been or are being delivered to all other parties to the arbitration in accordance with Article 4 by one or more means of delivery to be identified specifically in such confirmation, to be supported then or as soon as possible thereafter by documentary proof satisfactory to the LCIA Court of actual delivery (including the date of delivery) or, if actual delivery is demonstrated to be impossible to the LCIA Court's satisfaction, sufficient information as to any other effective form of notification.\n\n2.2 Where the Request is a composite Request, the Respondent may serve a composite Response in respect of all or any of the arbitrations, provided that the requirements of Article 2.1 are complied with to the satisfaction of the LCIA Court in respect of each arbitration to which the Response responds.\n\n2.3 The Response (including all accompanying documents) shall be submitted to the Registrar in electronic form in accordance with Article 4.1.\n\n2.4 Failure to nominate or propose any arbitrator candidate within the time for delivery of a Response or such other time period as is agreed by the parties shall constitute an irrevocable waiver of that party's opportunity to nominate or propose any arbitrator candidate. Failure to deliver any or any part of a Response within time or at all shall not (by itself) preclude the Respondent from denying any claim or from advancing any defence, counterclaim or cross-claim in the arbitration.\n\n2.5 Subject to Article 2.4, at any time prior to the appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal the LCIA Court may allow a party to supplement, modify or amend its Response to correct any error in computation, any clerical or typographical error, any ambiguity or any mistake of a similar nature, after giving the parties a reasonable opportunity to state their views and upon such terms as the LCIA Court may decide.\n\n2.6 There may be one or more Respondents (whether or not jointly represented); and in such event, where appropriate, the term \"Respondent\" shall be so interpreted under the Arbitration Agreement.\n\nARTICLE 3 - LCIA COURT AND REGISTRAR\n\n3.1 The functions of the LCIA Court under the Arbitration Agreement shall be performed in its name by the President of the LCIA Court (or any of its Vice Presidents, Honorary Vice Presidents or former Vice Presidents) or by a division of three or more members of the LCIA Court appointed by its President or any Vice President (the \"LCIA Court\").\n\n3.2 The functions of the Registrar under the Arbitration Agreement shall be performed under the supervision of the LCIA Court by the Registrar or any deputy Registrar.\n\n3.3 All communications in the arbitration to the LCIA Court from any party, authorised representative of a party, arbitrator, tribunal secretary or expert to the Arbitral Tribunal shall be addressed to the Registrar. All such communications with the Registrar from any party or authorised representative of a party shall be copied to all other parties.\n\nARTICLE 4 - WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AND PERIODS OF TIME\n\n4.1 The Claimant shall submit the Request under Article 1.3 and the Respondent the Response under Article 2.3 in electronic form, either by email or other electronic means including via any electronic filing system operated by the LCIA.\n\n4.2 Save with the prior written approval or direction of the Arbitral Tribunal, or, prior to the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal, the Registrar acting on behalf of the LCIA Court, any written communication in relation to the arbitration shall be delivered by email or any other electronic means of communication that provides a record of its transmission.\n\n4.3 Delivery by email or other electronic means of communication shall be as agreed or designated by a party for the purpose of receiving any communication in regard to the Arbitration Agreement.\n\n4.4 For the purpose of determining the commencement of any time limit, unless otherwise ordered by the Arbitral Tribunal or the Registrar acting on behalf of the LCIA Court, a written communication sent by electronic means shall be treated as having been received by a party on the day it is transmitted.\n\n4.5 For the purpose of determining compliance with a time limit, unless otherwise ordered by the Arbitral Tribunal or the Registrar acting on behalf of the LCIA Court, a written communication shall be treated as having been made by a party if transmitted or delivered prior to or on the date of the expiration of the time limit.\n\n4.6 For the purpose of calculating a period of time, such period shall begin to run on the day following the day when a written communication is received by the addressee.\n\n4.7 A party shall inform the Registrar, the Arbitral Tribunal and all other parties as soon as reasonably practical of any changes to its full name and contact details.\n\nARTICLE 5 - FORMATION OF ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL\n\n5.1 The formation of the Arbitral Tribunal by the LCIA Court shall not be impeded by any controversy between the parties relating to the sufficiency of the Request or the Response.\n\n5.2 The expression the \"Arbitral Tribunal\" includes a sole arbitrator (including, where appropriate, an Emergency Arbitrator) or all the arbitrators where more than one.\n\n5.3 All arbitrators shall be and remain at all times impartial and independent of the parties; and none shall act in the arbitration as advocate for or authorised representative of any party.\n\n5.4 Before appointment by the LCIA Court, each arbitrator candidate shall furnish to the Registrar a brief written summary of his or her qualifications and professional positions.\n\n5.5 Each arbitrator shall assume a continuing duty, until the arbitration is finally concluded, forthwith to disclose in writing any circumstances becoming known to that arbitrator which are likely to give rise in the mind of any party to any justifiable doubts as to his or her impartiality or independence.\n\n5.6 The LCIA Court shall appoint the Arbitral Tribunal promptly following delivery to the Registrar of the Response or, if no Response is received, promptly after 28 days from the Commencement Date.\n\n5.7 No party or third person may appoint any arbitrator under the Arbitration Agreement: the LCIA Court alone is empowered to appoint arbitrators.\n\n5.8 A sole arbitrator shall be appointed unless the parties have agreed in writing otherwise or the LCIA Court determines that in the circumstances a three-member tribunal is appropriate.\n\n5.9 The LCIA Court shall appoint arbitrators with due regard for any particular method or criteria of selection agreed in writing by the parties.\n\n5.10 The President of the LCIA Court shall only be eligible to be appointed as an arbitrator if the parties agree in writing to nominate him or her as the sole or presiding arbitrator.\n\nARTICLE 6 - NATIONALITY OF ARBITRATORS AND PARTIES\n\n6.1 Upon request of the Registrar, the parties shall each inform the Registrar and all other parties of their nationality. Where the parties are of different nationalities, a sole arbitrator or the presiding arbitrator shall not have the same nationality as any party unless the parties who are not of the same nationality as the arbitrator candidate all agree in writing otherwise.\n\n6.2 For the purposes of Article 6.1, in the case of a natural person, nationality shall mean citizenship, whether acquired by birth or naturalisation or other requirements of the nation concerned.\n\n6.3 A person who is a citizen of two or more States shall be treated as a national of each State.\n\nARTICLE 7 - PARTY AND OTHER NOMINATIONS\n\n7.1 If the parties have agreed howsoever that any arbitrator is to be appointed by one or more of them or by any third person (other than the LCIA Court), that agreement shall be treated under the Arbitration Agreement as an agreement to nominate an arbitrator for all purposes.\n\n7.2 Where the parties have howsoever agreed that the Claimant or the Respondent or any third person (other than the LCIA Court) is to nominate an arbitrator and such nomination is not made within time, the LCIA Court may appoint an arbitrator notwithstanding the absence of a nomination.\n\n7.3 In the absence of written agreement between the Parties, no party may unilaterally nominate a sole arbitrator or presiding arbitrator.\n\nARTICLE 8 - THREE OR MORE PARTIES\n\n8.1 Where the Arbitration Agreement entitles each party howsoever to nominate an arbitrator, the parties to the dispute number more than two and such parties have not all agreed in writing that the disputant parties represent collectively two separate \"sides\" for the formation of the Arbitral Tribunal, the LCIA Court shall appoint the Arbitral Tribunal without regard to any party's entitlement or nomination.\n\n8.2 In such circumstances, the Arbitration Agreement shall be treated for all purposes as a written agreement by the parties for the nomination and appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal by the LCIA Court alone.\n\nARTICLE 9A - EXPEDITED FORMATION OF ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL\n\n9.1 In the case of exceptional urgency, any party may apply to the LCIA Court for the expedited formation of the Arbitral Tribunal under Article 5.\n\n9.2 Such an application shall be made to the Registrar in writing by electronic means, together with a copy of the Request (if made by a Claimant) or a copy of the Response (if made by a Respondent).\n\n9.3 The LCIA Court shall determine the application as expeditiously as possible in the circumstances.\n\nARTICLE 9B - EMERGENCY ARBITRATOR\n\n9.4 Subject always to Article 9.16 below, in the case of emergency at any time prior to the formation or expedited formation of the Arbitral Tribunal, any party may apply to the LCIA Court for the immediate appointment of a temporary sole arbitrator to conduct emergency proceedings (the \"Emergency Arbitrator\").\n\n9.5 Such an application shall be made to the Registrar in writing by electronic means, together with a copy of the Request or Response, setting out the specific grounds for requiring, as an emergency, the appointment of an Emergency Arbitrator and the specific claim, with reasons, for emergency relief.\n\n9.6 The LCIA Court shall determine the application as soon as possible in the circumstances. If the application is granted, an Emergency Arbitrator shall be appointed by the LCIA Court within three days of the Registrar's receipt of the application.\n\n9.7 The Emergency Arbitrator may conduct the emergency proceedings in any manner determined by the Emergency Arbitrator to be appropriate in the circumstances.\n\n9.8 The Emergency Arbitrator shall decide the claim for emergency relief as soon as possible, but no later than 14 days following the Emergency Arbitrator's appointment.\n\n9.9 An order of the Emergency Arbitrator shall be made in writing, with reasons. An award of the Emergency Arbitrator shall comply with Article 26.2.\n\n9.10 The Special Fee paid shall form a part of the Arbitration Costs under Article 28.1.\n\n9.11 Any order or award of the Emergency Arbitrator may be confirmed, varied, discharged or revoked by order or award made by the Arbitral Tribunal upon application by any party or upon its own initiative.\n\n9.12 Prior to the formation of the Arbitral Tribunal, the Emergency Arbitrator may confirm, vary, discharge or revoke, in whole or in part, any order of the Emergency Arbitrator.\n\n9.13 Notwithstanding Article 9B, a party may apply to a competent state court or other legal authority for any interim or conservatory measures before the formation of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n9.14 Articles 3.3, 4, 13.1-13.4, 14.1-14.2, 14.5, 14A, 16, 17, 18, 22.3-22.4, 23, 24A, 25.1, 25.3, 28, 29, 30, 30A, 31 and 32 and the Annex shall apply to emergency proceedings.\n\n9.15 The LCIA Court shall have the power to decide, at its discretion, all matters relating to the administration of the emergency proceedings not expressly provided for in this Article 9B.\n\n9.16 Article 9B shall not apply if either: (i) the parties have concluded their arbitration agreement before 1 October 2014 and the parties have not agreed in writing to 'opt in' to Article 9B; or (ii) the parties have agreed in writing at any time to 'opt out' of Article 9B.\n\nARTICLE 9C - EXPEDITED APPOINTMENT OF REPLACEMENT ARBITRATOR\n\n9.17 Any party may apply to the LCIA Court to expedite the appointment of a replacement arbitrator under Article 11.\n\n9.18 Such an application shall be made in writing to the Registrar by electronic means.\n\n9.19 The LCIA Court shall determine the application as expeditiously as possible in the circumstances.\n\nARTICLE 10 - REVOCATION AND CHALLENGES\n\n10.1 The LCIA Court may revoke any arbitrator's appointment upon its own initiative, at the written request of all other members of the Arbitral Tribunal or upon a written challenge by any party if: (i) that arbitrator gives written notice to the LCIA Court of his or her intent to resign as arbitrator; (ii) that arbitrator falls seriously ill, refuses or becomes unable or unfit to act; or (iii) circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to that arbitrator's impartiality or independence.\n\n10.2 The LCIA Court may determine that an arbitrator is unfit to act under Article 10.1 if that arbitrator: (i) acts in deliberate violation of the Arbitration Agreement;

EXPERT TO ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL\n\n21.1 The Arbitral Tribunal, after consultation with the parties, may appoint one or more experts to report in writing to the Arbitral Tribunal and the parties on specific issues in the arbitration.\n\n21.2 Any such expert shall be and remain impartial and independent of the parties.\n\n21.3 The Arbitral Tribunal may require any party at any time to give to such expert any relevant information or to provide access to any relevant documents or property.\n\n21.4 If any party so requests or the Arbitral Tribunal considers it necessary, the Arbitral Tribunal may order the expert, after delivery of the expert's written report, to attend a hearing.\n\n21.5 The fees and expenses of any expert appointed by the Arbitral Tribunal shall form part of the Arbitration Costs.\n\nARTICLE 22 -

AWARD(S)\n\n26.1 The Arbitral Tribunal may make separate awards on different issues at different times, including interim payments on account of any claim, counterclaim or cross-claim.\n\n26.2 The Arbitral Tribunal shall make any award in writing and, unless all parties agree in writing otherwise, shall state the reasons upon which such award is based.\n\n26.3 An award may be expressed in any currency, unless the parties have agreed otherwise.\n\n26.4 Unless the parties have agreed otherwise, the Arbitral Tribunal may order that simple or compound interest shall be paid by any party on any sum awarded.\n\n26.5 Where there is more than one arbitrator and the Arbitral Tribunal fails to agree on any issue, the arbitrators shall decide that issue by a majority.\n\n26.6 If any arbitrator refuses or fails to sign an award, the signatures of the majority or of the presiding arbitrator shall be sufficient.\n\n26.7 The sole or presiding arbitrator shall be responsible for delivering the award to the LCIA Court, which shall transmit to the parties the award authenticated by the Registrar as an LCIA award.\n\n26.8 Every award (including reasons for such award) shall be final and binding on the parties.\n\n26.9 In the event of any final settlement of the parties' dispute, the Arbitral Tribunal may decide to make an award recording the settlement if the parties jointly so request in writing (a \"Consent Award\").\n\nARTICLE 27 -

DATA PROTECTION\n\n30.4 Any processing of personal data by the LCIA is subject to applicable data protection legislation.\n\n30.5 In accordance with its duties under Article 14.1, at an early stage of the arbitration the Arbitral Tribunal shall, in consultation with the parties and where appropriate the LCIA, consider whether it is appropriate to adopt any specific information security measures or any means to address the processing of personal data.\n\n30.6 The LCIA and the Arbitral Tribunal may issue directions addressing information security or data protection, which shall be binding on the parties.\n\nARTICLE 31 -

of this Part are founded on the following principles, and shall be \nconstrued accordingly—\n(a)\nthe object of arbitration is to obtain the fair resolution of disputes by an \nimpartial tribunal without unnecessary delay or expense;\n(b)\nthe parties should be free to agree how their disputes are resolved, subject \nonly to such safeguards as are necessary in the public interest;\n(c)\nin matters governed by this Part the court should not intervene except as \nprovided by this Part.\n2\nScope of application of provisions.\n(1) The provisions of this Part apply where the seat of the arbitration is in England and \nWales or Northern Ireland.\n(2) The following sections apply even if the seat of the arbitration is outside England and \nWales or Northern Ireland or no seat has been designated or determined—\n[F1(za)\nsection 6A (law applicable to arbitration agreement),]\n(a)\nsections 9 to 11 (stay of legal proceedings, &c.), and\n(b)\nsection 66 (enforcement of arbitral awards).\n(3) The powers conferred by the following sections apply even if the seat of the arbitration \nis outside England and Wales or Northern Ireland or no seat has been designated or\ndetermined—\n(a)\nsection 43 (securing the attendance of witnesses), and\n(b)\nsection 44 (court powers exercisable in support of arbitral proceedings);\nbut the court may refuse to exercise any such power if, in the opinion of the court, the \nfact that the seat of the arbitration is outside England and Wales or Northern Ireland, or \nthat when designated or determined the seat is likely to be outside England and Wales \nor Northern Ireland, makes it inappropriate to do so.\n(4) The court may exercise a power conferred by any provision of this Part not mentioned \nin subsection (2) or (3) for the purpose of supporting the arbitral process where—\n(a)\nno seat of the arbitration has been designated or determined, and\n(b)\nby reason of a connection with England and Wales or Northern Ireland the \ncourt is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so.\n(5) Section 7 (separability of arbitration agreement) and section 8 (death of a party) apply \nwhere the law applicable to the arbitration agreement is the law of England and Wales \nor Northern Ireland even if the seat of the arbitration is outside England and Wales or \nNorthern Ireland or has not been designated or determined.\n\nArbitration Act 1996 (c. 23)\nPart I – Arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement\n\n5\n\n\neffects for the Arbitration Act 1996. \nTextual Amendments\nF1\nS. 2(2)(za) inserted

arbitration\ndesignated—\n(a)\nby the parties to the arbitration agreement, or\n(b)\nby any arbitral or other institution or person vested by the parties with powers \nin that regard, or\n(c)\nby the arbitral tribunal if so authorised by the parties,\nor determined, in the absence of any such designation, having regard to the parties’ \nagreement and all the relevant circumstances.\n4\nMandatory and non-mandatory provisions.\n(1) The mandatory provisions of this Part are listed in Schedule 1 and have effect \nnotwithstanding any agreement to the contrary.\n(2) The other provisions of this Part (the “non-mandatory provisions”) allow the parties \nto make their own arrangements by agreement but provide rules which apply in the \nabsence of such agreement.\n(3) The parties may make such arrangements by agreeing to the application of institutional \nrules or providing any other means by which a matter may be decided.\n(4) It is immaterial whether or not the law applicable to the parties’ agreement is the law \nof England and Wales or, as the case may be, Northern Ireland.\n(5) The choice of a law other than the law of England and Wales or Northern Ireland as \nthe applicable law in respect of a matter provided for by a non-mandatory provision \nof this Part is equivalent to an agreement making provision about that matter.\nFor this purpose an applicable law determined in accordance with the parties’ \nagreement, or which is objectively determined in the absence of any express or implied \nchoice, shall be treated as chosen by the parties.\n5\nAgreements to be in writing.\n(1) The provisions of this Part apply only where the arbitration agreement is in writing, \nand any other agreement between the parties as to any matter is effective for the \npurposes of this Part only if in writing.\nThe expressions “agreement”, “agree” and “agreed” shall be construed accordingly.\n(2) There is an agreement in writing—\n(a)\nif the agreement is made in writing (whether or not it is signed by the parties),\n(b)\nif the agreement is made by exchange of communications in writing, or\n(c)\nif the agreement is evidenced in writing.\n(3) Where parties agree otherwise than in writing by reference to terms which are in \nwriting, they make an agreement in writing.\n\n6\nArbitration Act 1996 (c. 23)\nPart I – Arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement\n\n\n\neffects for the Arbitration Act 1996. \n(4) An agreement is evidenced in writing if an agreement made otherwise than in writing \nis recorded by one of the parties, or by a third party, with the authority of the parties \nto the agreement.\n(5) An exchange of written submissions in arbitral or legal proceedings in which the \nexistence of an agreement otherwise than in writing is alleged by one party against \nanother party and not denied by the other party in his response constitutes as between \nthose parties an agreement in writing to the effect alleged.\n(6) References in this Part to anything being written or in writing include its being \nrecorded by any means.\nThe arbitration agreement\n6\nDefinition of arbitration agreement.\n(1) In this Part an “arbitration agreement” means an agreement to submit to arbitration \npresent or future disputes (whether they are contractual or not).\n(2) The reference in an agreement to a written form of arbitration clause or to a document \ncontaining an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement if the reference is \nsuch as to make that clause part of the agreement.\n[F26A\nLaw applicable to arbitration agreement\n(1) The law applicable to an arbitration agreement is—\n(a)\nthe law that the parties expressly agree applies to the arbitration agreement, or\n(b)\nwhere no such agreement is made, the law of the seat of the arbitration in \nquestion.\n(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), agreement between the parties that a particular \nlaw applies to an agreement of which the arbitration agreement forms a part does not \nconstitute express agreement that that law also applies to the arbitration agreement.\n(3) Subsection (1) does not apply to an arbitration agreement derived from a standing \noffer to submit disputes to arbitration where the offer is contained in—\n(a)\na treaty, or\n(b)\nlegislation of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom.\n(4) In this section—\n“legislation” includes any provision of a legislative character;\n“treaty” includes any international agreement (and any protocol or annex \nto a treaty or international agreement).]\nTextual Amendments\nF2\nS. 6A inserted (1.8.2025) by Arbitration Act 2025 (c. 4), ss. 1(2), 17(2); S.I. 2025/905, reg. 2\n\nArbitration Act 1996 (c. 23)\nPart I – Arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement\n\n7\n\n\neffects for the Arbitration Act 1996. \n7\nSeparability of arbitration agreement.\nUnless otherwise agreed by the parties, an arbitration agreement which forms or was \nintended to form part of another agreement (whether or not in writing) shall not \nbe regarded as invalid, non-existent or ineffective because that other agreement is \ninvalid, or did not come into existence or has become ineffective, and it shall for that \npurpose be treated as a distinct agreement.\n8\nWhether agreement discharged by death of a party.\n(1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an arbitration agreement is not discharged by \nthe death of a party and may be enforced by or against the personal representatives \nof that party.\n(2) Subsection (1) does not affect the operation of any enactment or rule of law by virtue \nof which a substantive right or obligation is extinguished by death.\nStay of legal proceedings\n9\nStay of legal proceedings.\n(1) A party to an arbitration agreement against whom legal proceedings are brought \n(whether by way of claim or counterclaim) in respect of a matter which under the \nagreement is to be referred to arbitration may (upon notice to the other parties to the \nproceedings) apply to the court in which the proceedings have been brought to stay \nthe proceedings so far as they concern that matter.\n(2) An application may be made notwithstanding that the matter is to be referred to \narbitration only after the exhaustion of other dispute resolution procedures.\n(3) An application may not be made by a person before taking the appropriate procedural \nstep (if any) to acknowledge the legal proceedings against him or after he has taken \nany step in those proceedings to answer the substantive claim.\n(4) On an application under this section the court shall grant a stay unless satisfied that the \narbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative, or incapable of being performed.\n(5) If the court refuses to stay the legal proceedings, any provision that an award is a \ncondition precedent to the bringing of legal proceedings in respect of any matter is of \nno effect in relation to those proceedings.\n10\nReference of interpleader issue to arbitration.\n(1) Where in legal proceedings relief by way of interpleader is granted and any issue \nbetween the claimants is one in respect of which there is an arbitration agreement \nbetween them, the court granting the relief shall direct that the issue be determined \nin accordance with the agreement unless the circumstances are such that proceedings \nbrought by a claimant in respect of the matter would not be stayed.\n(2) Where subsection (1) applies but the court does not direct that the issue be determined \nin accordance with the arbitration agreement, any provision that an award is a \ncondition precedent to the bringing of legal proceedings in respect of any matter shall \nnot affect the determination of that issue by the court.\n\n8\nArbitration Act 1996 (c. 23)\nPart I – Arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement\n\n\n\neffects for the Arbitration Act 1996. \n11\nRetention of security where Admiralty proceedings stayed.\n(1) Where Admiralty proceedings are stayed on the ground that the dispute in question \nshould be submitted to arbitration, the court granting the stay may, if in those \nproceedings property has been arrested or bail or other security has been given to \nprevent or obtain release from arrest—\n(a)\norder that the property arrested be retained as security for the satisfaction of \nany award given in the arbitration in respect of that dispute, or\n(b)\norder that the stay of those proceedings be conditional on the provision of \nequivalent security for the satisfaction of any such award.\n(2) Subject to any provision made by rules of court and to any necessary modifications, \nthe same law and practice shall apply in relation to property retained in pursuance of \nan order as would apply if it were held for the purposes of proceedings in the court \nmaking the order.\nCommencement of arbitral proceedings\n12\nPower of court to extend time for beginning arbitral proceedings, &c.\n(1) Where an arbitration agreement to refer future disputes to arbitration provides that a \nclaim shall be barred, or the claimant’s right extinguished, unless the claimant takes \nwithin a time fixed by the agreement some step—\n(a)\nto begin arbitral proceedings, or\n(b)\nto begin other dispute resolution procedures which must be exhausted before \narbitral proceedings can be begun,\nthe court may by order extend the time for taking that step.\n(2) Any party to the arbitration agreement may apply for such an order (upon notice to \nthe other parties), but only after a claim has arisen and after exhausting any available \narbitral process for obtaining an extension of time.\n(3) The court shall make an order only if satisfied—\n(a)\nthat the circumstances are such as were outside the reasonable contemplation \nof the parties when they agreed the provision in question, and that it would \nbe just to extend the time, or\n(b)\nthat the conduct of one party makes it unjust to hold the other party to the \nstrict terms of the provision in question.\n(4) The court may extend the time for such period and on such terms as it thinks fit, and \nmay do so whether or not the time previously fixed (by agreement or by a previous \norder) has expired.\n(5) An order under this section does not affect the operation of the Limitation Acts (see \nsection 13).\n(6) The leave of the court is required for any appeal from a decision of the court under \nthis section.\n13\nApplication of Limitation Acts.\n(1) The Limitation Acts apply to arbitral proceedings as they apply to legal proceedings.\n\nArbitration Act 1996 (c. 23)\nPart I – Arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement\n\n9\n\n\neffects for the Arbitration Act 1996. \n(2) The court may order that in computing the time prescribed by the Limitation Acts \nfor the commencement of proceedings (including arbitral proceedings) in respect of \na dispute which was the subject matter—\n(a)\nof an award which the court orders to be set aside or declares to be of no \neffect, or\n(b)\nof the affected part of an award which the court orders to be set aside in part, \nor declares to be in part of no effect,\nthe period between the commencement of the arbitration and the date of the order \nreferred to in paragraph (a) or (b) shall be excluded.\n(3) In determining for the purposes of the Limitation Acts when a cause of action \naccrued, any provision that an award is a condition precedent to the bringing of legal \nproceedings in respect of a matter to which an arbitration agreement applies shall be \ndisregarded.\n(4) In this Part “the Limitation Acts” means—\n(a)\nin England and Wales, the M1Limitation Act 1980, the M2Foreign Limitation \nPeriods Act 1984 and any other enactment (whenever passed) relating to the \nlimitation of actions;\n(b)\nin Northern Ireland, the M3Limitation (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, the\nM4Foreign Limitation Periods

Part and for the purposes of the Limitation Acts.\n(2) If there is no such agreement the following provisions apply.\n(3) Where the arbitrator is named or designated in the arbitration agreement, arbitral \nproceedings are commenced in respect of a matter when one party serves on the other \nparty or parties a notice in writing requiring him or them to submit that matter to the \nperson so

or\n\t\n(b)\t The Parties to the treaty or, in the case of a multi­\nlateral treaty, the State of the claimant and the respondent State, \nhave agreed after 1 April 2014 to their application.\nApplication of the Rules\n3.\t\nIn any arbitration in which the Rules on Transparency \napply pursuant to a treaty or to an agreement by the Parties to \nthat treaty:\n\t\n(a)\t The disputing parties may not derogate from these \nRules, by agreement or otherwise, unless permitted to do so by \nthe treaty;\n\t\n*For the purposes of the Rules on Transparency, a “treaty” shall be under-\nstood broadly as encompassing any bilateral or multilateral treaty that contains \nprovisions on the protection of investments or investors and a right for investors \nto resort to arbitration against Parties to the treaty, including any treaty commonly \nreferred to as a free trade agreement, economic integration agreement, trade and \ninvestment framework or cooperation agreement, or bilateral investment treaty.\n\t\n**For the purposes of the Rules on Transparency, any reference to a “Party \nto the treaty” or a “State” includes, for example, a regional economic integration \norganization where it is a Party to the treaty.\n\n6\n\t\n(b)\t The arbitral tribunal shall have the power, besides its \ndiscretionary authority under certain provisions of these Rules, \nto adapt the requirements of any specific provision of these \nRules to the particular circumstances of the case, after consulta-\ntion with the disputing parties, if such adaptation is necessary \nto conduct the arbitration in a practical manner and is consistent \nwith the transparency objective of these Rules.\nDiscretion and authority of the arbitral tribunal\n4.\t\nWhere the Rules on Transparency provide for the arbitral \ntribunal to exercise discretion, the arbitral tribunal in exercising \nsuch discretion shall take into account:\n\t\n(a)\t The public interest in transparency in treaty-based \ninvestor-State arbitration and in the particular arbitral proceed-\nings; and\n\t\n(b)\t The disputing parties’ interest in a fair and efficient \nresolution of their dispute.\n5.\t\nThese Rules shall not affect any authority that the arbitral \ntribunal may otherwise have under the UNCITRAL Arbitration \nRules to conduct the arbitration in such a manner as to promote \ntransparency, for example by accepting submissions from third \npersons.\n6.\t\nIn the presence of any conduct, measure or other action \nhaving the effect of wholly undermining the transparency objec-\ntives of these Rules, the arbitral tribunal shall ensure that those \nobjectives prevail.\nApplicable instrument in case of conflict\n7.\t\nWhere the Rules on Transparency apply, they shall sup-\nplement any applicable arbitration rules. Where there is a con-\nflict between the Rules on Transparency and the applicable \narbitration rules, the Rules on Transparency shall prevail. Not-\nwithstanding any provision in these Rules, where there is a \nconflict between the Rules on Transparency and the treaty, the \nprovisions of the treaty shall prevail.\n8.\t\nWhere any of these Rules is in conflict with a provision \nof the law applicable to the arbitration from which the disputing \nparties cannot derogate, that provision shall prevail.\n\n7\nApplication in non-UNCITRAL arbitrations\n9.\t\nThese Rules are available for use in investor-State arbi­\ntrations initiated under rules other than the UNCITRAL \n­Arbitration Rules or in ad hoc proceedings.\nArticle 2.  Publication of information at the  \ncommencement of arbitral proceedings\nOnce the notice of arbitration has been received by the respond-\nent, each of the disputing parties shall promptly communicate \na copy of the notice of arbitration to the repository referred to \nunder article 8. Upon receipt of the notice of arbitration from \nthe respondent, or upon receipt of the notice of arbitration and \na record of its transmission to the respondent, the repository \nshall promptly make available to the public information \n­regarding the name of the disputing parties, the economic \n­sector  involved and the treaty under which the claim is \nbeing made.\nArticle 3.  Publication of documents\n1.\t\nSubject to article 7, the following documents shall be made \navailable to the public: the notice of arbitration, the response \nto the notice of arbitration, the statement of claim, the statement \nof defence and any further written statements or written sub­\nmissions by any disputing party; a table listing all exhibits to \nthe aforesaid documents and to expert reports and witness \n­statements, if such table has been prepared for the proceedings, \nbut not the exhibits themselves; any written submissions by the \nnon-disputing Party (or Parties) to the treaty and by third \n­persons, transcripts of hearings, where available; and orders, \ndecisions and awards of the arbitral tribunal.\n2.\t\nSubject to article 7, expert reports and witness statements, \nexclusive of the exhibits thereto, shall be made available to the \npublic, upon request by any person to the arbitral tribunal.\n3.\t\nSubject to article 7, the arbitral tribunal may decide, on \nits own initiative or upon request from any person, and after \nconsultation with the disputing parties, whether and how to \nmake available exhibits and any other documents provided to, \nor issued by, the arbitral tribunal not falling within paragraphs 1 \nor 2 above. This may include, for example, making such docu-\nments available at a specified site.\n\n8\n4.\t\nThe documents to be made available to the public pursuant \nto paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be communicated by the arbitral \ntribunal to the repository referred to under article 8 as soon as \npossible, subject to any relevant arrangements or time limits for \nthe protection of confidential or protected information pre-\nscribed under article 7. The documents to be made available \npursuant to paragraph 3 may be communicated by the arbitral \ntribunal to the repository referred to under article 8 as they \nbecome available and, if applicable, in a redacted form in \naccordance with article 7. The repository shall make all docu-\nments available in a timely manner, in the form and in the \nlanguage in which it receives them.\n5.\t\nA person granted access to documents under paragraph 3 \nshall bear any administrative costs of making those documents \navailable to that person, such as the costs of photocopying or \nshipping documents to that person, but not the costs of making \nthose documents available to the public through the \nrepository.\nArticle 4.  Submission by a third person\n\t\n1.\t After consultation with the disputing parties, the arbi-\ntral tribunal may allow a person that is not a disputing party, \nand not a non-disputing Party to the treaty (“third person(s)”), \nto file a written submission with the arbitral tribunal regarding \na matter within the scope of the dispute.\n\t\n2.\t A third person wishing to make a submission shall \napply to the arbitral tribunal, and shall, in a concise written \nstatement, which is in a language of the arbitration and complies \nwith any page limits set by the arbitral tribunal:\n\t\n(a)\t Describe the third person, including, where relevant, \nits membership and legal status (e.g., trade association or other \nnon-governmental organization), its general objectives, the \nnature of its activities and any parent organization (including \nany organization that directly or indirectly controls the third \nperson);\n\t\n(b)\t Disclose any connection, direct or indirect, which the \nthird person has with any disputing party;\n\t\n(c)\t Provide information on any government, person or \norganization that has provided to the third person (i) any finan-\ncial or other assistance in preparing the submission; or (ii) \nsubstantial assistance in either of the two years preceding the \napplication by the third person under this article (e.g. funding \naround 20 per cent of its overall operations annually);\n\n9\n\t\n(d)\t Describe the nature of the interest that the third person \nhas in the arbitration; and\n\t\n(e)\t Identify the specific issues of fact or law in the arbi-\ntration that the third person wishes to address in its written \nsubmission.\n3.\t\nIn determining whether to allow such a submission, the \narbitral tribunal shall take into consideration, among other \n­factors it determines to be relevant:\n\t\n(a)\t Whether the third person has a significant interest in \nthe arbitral proceedings; and\n\t\n(b)\t The extent to which the submission would assist the \narbitral tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue \nrelated to the arbitral proceedings by bringing a perspective, \nparticular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the \ndisputing parties.\n4.\t\nThe submission filed by the third person shall:\n\t\n(a)\t Be dated and signed by the person filing the submis-\nsion on behalf of the third person;\n\t\n(b)\t Be concise, and in no case longer than as authorized \nby the arbitral tribunal;\n\t\n(c)\t Set out a precise statement of the third person’s posi-\ntion on issues; and\n\t\n(d)\t Address only matters within the scope of the dispute.\n5.\t\nThe arbitral tribunal shall ensure that any submission does \nnot disrupt or unduly burden the arbitral proceedings, or unfairly \nprejudice any disputing party.\n6.\t\nThe arbitral tribunal shall ensure that the disputing parties \nare given a reasonable opportunity to present their observations \non any submission by the third person.\nArticle 5.  Submission by a non-disputing Party \nto the treaty\n1.\t\nThe arbitral tribunal shall, subject to paragraph 4, allow, \nor, after consultation with the disputing parties, may invite, \nsubmissions on issues of treaty interpretation from a non-­\ndisputing Party to the treaty.\n2.\t\nThe arbitral tribunal, after consultation with the disputing \nparties, may allow submissions on further matters within the\n\n10\nscope of the dispute from a non-disputing Party to the treaty. \nIn determining whether to allow such submissions, the arbitral \ntribunal shall take into consideration, among other factors it \ndetermines to be relevant, the factors referred to in article 4, \nparagraph 3, and, for greater certainty, the need to avoid sub-\nmissions which would support the claim of the investor in a \nmanner tantamount to diplomatic protection.\n3.\t\nThe arbitral tribunal shall not draw any inference from the \nabsence of any submission or response to any invitation ­pursuant \nto paragraphs 1 or 2.\n4.\t\nThe arbitral tribunal shall ensure that any submission does \nnot disrupt or unduly burden the arbitral proceedings, or unfairly \nprejudice any disputing party.\n5.\t\nThe arbitral tribunal shall ensure that the disputing parties \nare given a reasonable opportunity to present their observations \non any submission by a non-disputing Party to the treaty.\nArticle 6.  Hearings\n1.\t\nSubject to article 6, paragraphs 2 and 3, hearings for the \npresentation of evidence or for oral argument (“hearings”) shall \nbe public. \n2.\t\nWhere there is a need to protect confidential information \nor the integrity of the arbitral process pursuant to article 7, the \narbitral tribunal shall make arrangements to hold in private that \npart of the hearing requiring such protection.\n3.\t\nThe arbitral tribunal shall make logistical arrangements to \nfacilitate the public access to hearings (including where appro-\npriate by organizing attendance through video links or such \nother means as it deems appropriate). However, the arbitral \ntribunal may, after consultation with the disputing parties, \ndecide to hold all or part of the hearings in private where this \nbecomes necessary for logistical reasons, such as when the cir-\ncumstances render any original arrangement for public access \nto a hearing infeasible.\nArticle 7.  Exceptions to transparency\nConfidential or protected information\n1.\t\nConfidential or protected information, as defined in para-\ngraph 2 and as identified pursuant to the arrangements referred\n\n11\nto in paragraphs 3 and 4, shall not be made available to the \npublic pursuant to articles 2 to 6. \n2.\t\nConfidential or protected information consists of: \n\t\n(a)\t Confidential business information; \n\t\n(b)\t Information that is protected against being made \navailable to the public under the treaty; \n\t\n(c)\t Information that is protected against being made \navailable to the public, in the case of the information of the \nrespondent State, under the law of the respondent State, and in \nthe case of other information, under any law or rules determined \nby the arbitral tribunal to be applicable to the disclosure of such \ninformation; or \n\t\n(d)\t Information the disclosure of which would impede \nlaw enforcement.\n3.\t\nThe arbitral tribunal, after consultation with the disputing \nparties, shall make arrangements to prevent any confidential or \nprotected information from being made available to the public, \nincluding by putting in place, as appropriate: \n\t\n(a)\t Time limits in which a disputing party, non-disputing \nParty to the treaty or third person shall give notice that it seeks \nprotection for such information in documents; \n\t\n(b)\t Procedures for the prompt designation and redaction \nof the particular confidential or protected information in such \ndocuments; and \n\t\n(c)\t Procedures for holding hearings in private to the \nextent required by article 6, paragraph 2. \nAny determination as to whether information is confidential or \nprotected shall be made by the arbitral tribunal after consulta-\ntion with the disputing parties.\n4.\t\nWhere the arbitral tribunal determines that information \nshould not be redacted from a document, or that a document \nshould not be prevented from being made available to the \n­public, any disputing party, non-disputing Party to the treaty or \nthird person that voluntarily introduced the document into the \nrecord shall be permitted to withdraw all or part of the docu-\nment from the record of the arbitral proceedings.\n5.\t\nNothing in these Rules requires a respondent State to make \navailable to the public information the disclosure of which it \nconsiders to be contrary to its essential security interests.\n\n12\nIntegrity of the arbitral process\n6.\t\nInformation shall not be made available to the public pur-\nsuant to articles 2 to 6 where the information, if made available \nto the public, would jeopardize the integrity of the arbitral \n­process as determined pursuant to paragraph 7.\n7.\t\nThe arbitral tribunal may, on its own initiative or upon the \napplication of a disputing party, after consultation with the \n­disputing parties where practicable, take appropriate measures \nto restrain or delay the publication of information where such \npublication would jeopardize the integrity of the arbitral process \nbecause it could hamper the collection or production of evi-\ndence, lead to the intimidation of witnesses, lawyers acting for \ndisputing parties or members of the arbitral tribunal, or in \n­comparably exceptional circumstances.\nArticle 8.  Repository of published information\nThe repository of published information under the Rules on \nTransparency shall be the Secretary-General of the United \nNations or an institution named by UNCITRAL.\n\n*1400030*\nPrinted in Austria\nV.14-00030—January 2014—750"}];
