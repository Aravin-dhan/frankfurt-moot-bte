<h2 id="section-the-facts" class="section-header">The Facts</h2>
<div class="para-block" id="para-2"><span class="para-num">2.</span><p>Long before the United States of America (the “USA”) joined World War I as a combatant on 6 April 1917, the American armaments industry had been producing military equipment and munitions for the Entente States. The pier of the peninsula Black Tom Island in New York Harbor was the largest transshipment point in the USA for shipments of arms and munition to Europe. Trains from the factories in Pennsylvania and New York State arrived at the pier. Their cargo was loaded onto barges and then transferred to larger ships bound for Europe. The Lehigh Valley Railroad Company (“LVRR”) operated by Black Tom pier together with a subsidiary, the National Docks and Railway Company.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-3"><span class="para-num">3.</span><p>Founded on 21 April 1846, LVRR got its name in 1853 under the leadership of entrepreneur Asa Packer. Holding a quarter of LVRR’s stock, he started to build a railroad network which would stretch from the Great Lakes to New York Harbor by the end of the 19th century.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-4"><span class="para-num">4.</span><p>In 1879, Asa Packer died. J.P. Morgan & Co. took his place and continued to drive the expansion.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-5"><span class="para-num">5.</span><p>On 3 October 1890, the Russian Prince Sergei Platonovich Obolensky Neledinsky- Meletzky, known as Serge Obolensky was born.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-6"><span class="para-num">6.</span><p>At the turn of the century, the economic prosperity of LVRR attracted many investors. In 1904, regular 10% dividends were revived.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-7"><span class="para-num">7.</span><p>In December 1910, the company’s stock capitalization was doubled from $ 40,000,000 to $ 80,000,000.  The company issued and sold shares for $ 50 per share. J.P. Morgan & Co. would continue to hold a quarter of the stock until the mid-1920s.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-8"><span class="para-num">8.</span><p>In 1915/1916, LVRR was an important carrier for the military industry. Despite an ordinance of Jersey City prohibiting the shipment of explosives within the city limits, LVRR had for some time been moving tons of munitions to its waterfront terminal on Black Tom Island. Since the departures of the ships could not always be planned, ammunition and explosives were often stored in waggons on site for up to a week.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-9"><span class="para-num">9.</span><p>On 30 July 1916, shortly after midnight, a fire broke out on Black Tom Island. At 2:08 am, the whole area of New York Harbor was shaken by a large explosion. That explosion was heard even 100 miles away. At 2:40 am, a second blast followed. Tons of ammunition and other explosives exploded, claiming the lives of at least four people and damaging the surrounding (including the Statue of Liberty) heavily. The ammunition and explosives included a very large shipment to be delivered to the Russian Empire. The total property damage resulting from the explosion ran to an estimated $ 20,000,000 (the “Black Tom Explosion”).</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-10"><span class="para-num">10.</span><p>One day later, investigations against the local officials of LVRR at Black Tom Island began. The background was that LVRR’s security measures at Black Tom Island were not strict. At night, the pier was guarded by six guards from LVRR and four guards paid by the Russian Empire and the British Empire, but there were no gates or other physical barriers to stop intruders. In addition, LVRR did not keep a locomotive on standby to move cars quickly in the event of a fire thereby violating the fire safety regulations of the US Interstate Commerce Commission. Despite a growing number of incidents regarding the production and the shipment of war related materials in 1916, the investigators did not attribute the explosions to sabotage.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-11"><span class="para-num">11.</span><p>In 1917, two revolutions happened in Russia. The February Revolution of 1917 led to the fall of the Imperial Government. The so-called Provisional Government of Prince Georgy Yevgenyevich Lvov succeeded.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-12"><span class="para-num">12.</span><p>On 22 March 1917, the USA recognized this Government.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-13"><span class="para-num">13.</span><p>During the October Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks took over, ousting the Provisional Government.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-14"><span class="para-num">14.</span><p>From November 1916 to April 1917, LVRR employed a detective agency to shadow a man called Michael Kristoff, who was suspected to be an arsonist and involved in the Black Tom Explosion. LVRR received the agency’s reports but kept them confidential.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-15"><span class="para-num">15.</span><p>On 3 February 1918, the Bolshevik Government adopted a decree repudiating all debts contracted by the Imperial and the Provisional Government. Under this decree, the Bolshevik Government cancelled all foreign debt owed by the Russian Empire.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-16"><span class="para-num">16.</span><p>On 21 March 1918, US Congress enacted the Railway Administration Act. Congress released the budgetary funds for a measure by which US President Woodrow Wilson had ordered most US railroads to be taken into State possession. The rationale for this measure was that the Black Tom Explosion and other incidents had shown that the railroad companies were unable to solve war-related problems such as congestion of tracks and lack of storage facilities. A government agency assumed control over LVRR’s tracks, port terminals and rolling stock. Pursuant to the Act, LVRR received “as just compensation an annual sum […] not exceeding a sum equivalent as nearly as may be to its average annual railway operating income for the three years ended June nineteen hundred and seventeen.”</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-17"><span class="para-num">17.</span><p>On 21 July 1918, a German submarine damaged a tugboat owned by LVRR off the east coast of Massachusetts. LVRR notified the Secretary of State of the damage suffered from this attack.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-18"><span class="para-num">18.</span><p>On 23 July 1918, Boris Bakhmetev, the ambassador of the Provisional Russian Government to the USA, began proceedings against LVRR. He acted on behalf of the “State of Russia”, as he put it in his claim, before the US District Court of New York. He claimed damages for the shipment not delivered to Russia as a result of the Black Tom Explosion. He argued that LVRR acted negligently in the handling of the explosives at Black Tom Island. He also emphasized that a considerable part of the munitions destroyed at Black Tom Island had already been owned by the Imperial Russian Government before the Black Tom Explosion.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-19"><span class="para-num">19.</span><p>In October 1918, Prince Obolensky fled Russia after he had fought as an officer against the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War and, before that, against the Germans during World War I. First, he stayed in Western Europe.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-20"><span class="para-num">20.</span><p>On 27 January 1919, LVRR’s motion to dismiss the action “on the ground that there was not in existence 'the Russian government,' and therefore no plaintiff” was rejected by the US District Court of New York. The Court reasoned: “It may be observed that the importance of recognizing governmental continuity, quite irrespective of considerations as to the existing form of a foreign government, or as to the human beings in control at any particular time, is well illustrated in this case, where it is sought to deprive a foreign state forever of the opportunity to be heard in an effort to recover for the loss of property which belonged to the foreign state; i.e., the “Russian government,” by whatever name called. It may also be noted, in passing, that the executive and judicial branches of the government have recognized “the present government of Russian” in proceedings to naturalize Russian subjects. Since the fall of the Imperial Russian government, such applicants for citizenship forswear allegiance to “the present government of Russia.”</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-21"><span class="para-num">21.</span><p>In addition to the lawsuit brought by the “State of Russia”, eleven civil lawsuits were filed against LVRR in connection with the Black Tom Explosion. LVRR denied any external cause for the explosions in court. LVRR relied upon a theory of spontaneous combustion in its defence. In the proceedings, LVRR did not submit the detective agency’s reports on Mr. Kristoff as evidence.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-22"><span class="para-num">22.</span><p>On 28 June 1919, the Peace Treaty of Versailles was signed between Germany and the “Allied and Associated Powers” (USA, the British Empire, France, Italy, Japan, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Cuba, Ecuador, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, The Hedjaz, Honduras, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, The Serb-Croat-Slovene State, Siam, Czecho-Slovakia and Uruguay) (the “Treaty of Versailles”). The Treaty of Versailles imposed reparations on Germany for “all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence” of World War I. In addition, it established the League of Nations. Absent Congress’ consent, the USA did not ratify the Peace Treaty of Versailles.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-23"><span class="para-num">23.</span><p>On 1 March 1920, the Transportation Act ended the USA’s State possession over the US railroads and reestablished private control over them.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-24"><span class="para-num">24.</span><p>On 25 August 1921, the USA and Germany signed a separate treaty, the Treaty concerning the re-establishment of Peace between Germany and the United States of America (the “Treaty of Berlin”), which entered into force on 11 November 1921. The Treaty of Berlin incorporated by reference most of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, in particular Germany’s obligation to pay reparations.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-25"><span class="para-num">25.</span><p>On 15 December 1921, the Bolshevik Government issued a decree “On the deprivation of citizenship rights of certain categories of persons abroad” (Decree No. 11). It stated: “1. Persons in the categories listed below who are abroad after the publication of this resolution shall be deprived of Russian citizenship: […] b) Persons who left Russia after November 7, 1917, without permission from the Soviet authorities. c) Persons who voluntarily served in armies that fought against the Soviet power or participated in any form in counter-revolutionary organizations. […]</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-2"><span class="para-num">2.</span><p>Persons named in subparagraphs “b” and “c” of Article 1 may, until June 1,1922, submit applications for the restoration of their rights to the All-Russian Central Executive Committee through the nearest representative offices.”</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-26"><span class="para-num">26.</span><p>Prince Obolensky did not apply for the restoration of his Russian citizenship under this Decree.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-27"><span class="para-num">27.</span><p>On 16 April 1922, Germany was the first major State to recognize the new Bolshevik Government. It signed the Treaty of Rapallo with the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, which would form the core of the Soviet Union founded at the end of the year.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-28"><span class="para-num">28.</span><p>On 10 August 1922, the USA and Germany signed the Supplementary Agreement to the Treaty of Berlin (the “Supplementary Agreement”). The two States agreed to submit the determinations of all reparations under the Treaty of Berlin to a Mixed Claims Commission (the “MCC”). Pursuant to Article 1 (2) of the Supplementary Agreement, the MCC should decide – amongst others – the following category of claim: “[…] claims for loss or damage to which the United States or its nationals have been subjected with respect to injuries to persons, or to property, rights and interests, including any company or association in which American nationals are interested, since July 31, 1914, as a consequence of the war”.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-29"><span class="para-num">29.</span><p>Article 2 sentence 1 of the Supplementary Agreement stated: “The Government of Germany and the Government of the United States shall each appoint one Commissioner. The two Governments shall by agreement select an Umpire to decide upon any cases concerning which the Commissioners may disagree, or upon any points of difference that may arise in the course of their proceedings.”</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-30"><span class="para-num">30.</span><p>Germany appointed Wilhelm Kiesselbach as Commissioner. The USA appointed Edwin Parker as Commissioner. Due to Germany’s limited negotiation power, the Umpire was selected de facto by the USA. The Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court, William Day, became the Umpire.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-31"><span class="para-num">31.</span><p>Article 6 (1) of the Supplementary Agreement stipulated that Germany and the USA could designate State Agents “who may present oral or written arguments to the commission.”</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-32"><span class="para-num">32.</span><p>On 15 November 1922, the MCC adopted its Rules of Procedure.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-33"><span class="para-num">33.</span><p>On 15 May 1923, Umpire Day resigned. The former Commissioner Parker became the new Umpire. The USA appointed Chandler Anderson as new Commissioner.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-34"><span class="para-num">34.</span><p>On 1 November 1923, the MCC adopted its Administrative Decision II. Administrative Decision II specified the parties before the MCC: “Though conducted in [sic] behalf of their respective citizens, governments are the real parties to international arbitrations. All claims, therefore, presented to this Commission shall be asserted and controlled by the United States as claimant, either on its own behalf or on behalf of one or more of its nationals. If in the decisions, opinions and proceedings of the Commission American nationals are referred to as claimants it will be understood that this is for the purpose of convenient designation and that the Government of the United States is the actual claimant.”</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-35"><span class="para-num">35.</span><p>Under this provision, the US Agent had the competence to make the final decisions regarding questions of strategy and arguments regarding its citizens’ claims. Private US claimants submitted a form containing information to the State Department. The private US claimants were also able to draft briefs for the State Agent’s considerations. However, the latter made the final decisions.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-36"><span class="para-num">36.</span><p>One of the claims by US claimants against Germany, listed as claim No. 11,333, was LVRR’s case of its tugboat damaged by a German submarine.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-37"><span class="para-num">37.</span><p>On 25 January 1924, LVRR requested to add its asserted damages claim arising out of the Black Tom Explosion to claim No. 11,333 . LVRR argued that it had obtained new evidence that German agents were responsible for the Black Tom Explosion. 82 other claimants also brought damages claims against Germany due to the Black Tom Explosion, mainly insurance companies and the relatives of the four persons deceased during the Black Tom Explosion. These claims were heard together. In the following, the claims of LVRR and the 82 other claimants regarding the Black Tom Explosion will be addressed together as the “Sabotage Claims”.</p></div>

<div class="para-block" id="para-46"><span class="para-num">46.</span><p>On 3 April 1929, the oral hearing in the Sabotage Claims began. The MCC assessed documentary evidence, witness testimonies and expert opinions. For instance, the US Agent submitted parts of LVRR’s detective agency’s reports on Mr. Kristoff as evidence.

<div class="para-block" id="para-48"><span class="para-num">48.</span><p>On 16 October 1930, the MCC held in its award: “[A.] In speaking […] we have not the least intention to raise any doubt as to the entire good faith of the present German Government in its management and presentation of these cases, nor of the Agent who has represented Germany as counsel. And in order that this last statement may not be construed as merely conventional courtesy, we state specifically that we have no such doubts. We believe that the present German Government was entirely prepared to bring out the truth and to take the consequences, whatever they might be. [B.] It is unnecessary to go further and determine whether such sabotage was the general policy of the then German Government. […]There was an admitted policy to destroy and damage property of the nations at war with Germany at this time and later, and it is obvious that such acts if committed in or from the United States were serious violations of neutrality, that agents engaged therein were not likely to discriminate very carefully between acts on United States territory and acts outside the United States, or between property belonging to Germany’s enemies and property not yet delivered, but intended for Germany’s enemies. But in general we are all inclined to the opinion that Germany’s diplomatic representatives in the United States were averse to attacks on American property […]. And up to the entry of the United States into the war there were in the United States certain German agents who were, or at least pretended to be, active in sabotage work. But we are also convinced that the number of agents so engaged was always small in proportion to the field to be covered, that they were never organized effectively, and that their numbers and effectiveness continually decreased […]. […] [C.] Hilken and Herrmann are both liars, not presumptive but proven. No one could in the light of all their evidence believe anything either says unless something other than his own assertion confirmed his statements. […] [D.] So far as we can see, the circumstances of the fire leave the question of its cause open. It may have been some fault in the preparation of the powder in the shells in this car; it may have come from some other cause connected with explosives, for though we know of no cause which would naturally be suggested by the supposed contents of this car we are suspicious of explosives in general; it may have come from some other accident of which no evidence appears; of course the fire may have been of incendiary origin, and in this connection it may be noted that all incendiaries are not German agents. […] [E.] Suspicion was focussed very early on Kristoff in connection with Black Tom. [His aunt] said that she at some earlier time saw something like a blueprint or blueprints in Kristoff’s room, when he was in her house, and that in his absence she once read a letter, which he had written but had not yet sent, to a man named Grandson or Grandor, demanding a large sum of money. […] [F.] The name Grantnor is of great significance in this case. The connection between Kristoff and Hinsch, who was a German agent and who is alleged to have used Kristoff as his tool in Black Tom, depends substantially on whether Hinsch used the name Grantnor as an alias. […] According to Kristoff, Grantnor met him in the Pennsylvania Station in New York, asked him the time, got to talking, and then and there employed him to take with him a long trip covering many cities, including cities as far west as Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis […]. Kristoff knew nothing whatever about what Grantnor did on these trips, except that Grantnor told him he was trying to get contracts. Grantnor had two suitcases which Kristoff said contained plans and blueprints. Kristoff’s sole duties were to carry the suitcases and to watch them when Grantnor was not in his room. […] The story is suspicious enough in all conscience. If Grantnor can be shown to be Hinsch, we can easily get a good deal of truth out of the story and add a good deal of detail. Hinsch himself testifies that he never went further west than Gettysburg. […] [G.] We have not all of [the detective agency’s] reports. Why we do not know. We get the impression that the reports we have […] were selected and put together in the shape submitted to us. […] Whatever the explanation, the reports as submitted to us omit much that seems important to us. [….] And [the detective], entirely unconsciously, discredits every admission by Kristoff which appears in his reports […]. […] One singular omission is that Kristoff does not congregate with other German agents. The urge to congregate is in all the other testimony the most marked characteristic of all German agents. But we hear nothing of Kristoff’s meeting other German agents or even sympathizers.”</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-49"><span class="para-num">49.</span><p>The MCC rejected the claims and concluded: “We cannot be sure that Kristoff did not set fire to Black Tom or take some part in so doing. […] But it will sufficiently appear from the foregoing that, as we have said, the evidence falls far short of enabling us to reach the point, not merely of holding Germany responsible for the fire, but of thinking that her agents must have been the cause, even though the proof is lacking.”</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-50"><span class="para-num">50.</span><p>On 12 January 1931, the US Agent filed the First Petition for Rehearing. He argued that a procedural error had taken place because the Umpire not only participated in the deliberations but also co-signed the judgment. The US Agent argued that this violated Art. 2 of the Supplementary Agreement which addresses “their [the Commissioners’] proceedings.”</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-51"><span class="para-num">51.</span><p>LVRR criticized the award as a “political decision”.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-52"><span class="para-num">52.</span><p>On 30 March 1931, the MCC rejected the application for rehearing unanimously by referring to its consuetudo: “The Umpire participated in the deliberations of the Commissioners and in the opinion in accordance with the usual practice of the Commission in cases of importance since its foundation in 1922, a practice never before questioned and not in our judgment of doubtful validity even if it had not so long been accepted by all concerned.”</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-53"><span class="para-num">53.</span><p>From 1 July 1931 onwards, LVRR discontinued dividend payments.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-54"><span class="para-num">54.</span><p>On 1 July 1931, the US Agent filed the Second Petition for Rehearing. He argued that new evidence would proof that the MCC incorrectly dismissed Germany’s responsibility for the Black Tom Explosion. The new evidence submitted by the US Agent included an issue of the Blue Book magazine of January 1917 containing a code message (written with lemon juice) forwarded by Fred Herrmann who had fled to Mexico to Paul Hilken in Baltimore, the so called “Herrmann Message”. Both Frederick Herrmann and Paul Hilken served as German operatives in the USA. According to the US Agent, Paul Hilken only discovered the Herrmann Message in December 1930 in his attic. The Herrmann Message stated the following: “Have seen Eckhardt he is suspicious of me Can’t convince him I come from Maguerre and Nadolny Have told him all reference Hinsch and I Deutschland, Jersey City Terminal, Kingsland, Savannah, and Tony’s Lab. he doubts me on account of my bum German Confirm to him thru your channels all O.K. and my mission here I have no funds Eckhardt claims he is short of money send ly [by] bearer U.S. 25000.— Have you heard from Willie Have wired Hildegard but no answer Be careful of her and connections Where are Hinsch and Carl Ahrendt Tell Hinsch to come here I expect to go north but he can locate me thru Eckhardt I dont trust Carl Ahrendt, Kristoff, Wolfgang and that Hoboken bunch If cornered they might get us in Dutch with authorities See that Hinsch brings with him all who might implicate us tell him Siegel is with me.

<div class="para-block" id="para-56"><span class="para-num">56.</span><p>On 29 March 1932, Supreme Court Associate Justice Owen Roberts was appointed as new Umpire after Boyden had passed away in October 1931.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-57"><span class="para-num">57.</span><p>On 3 December 1932, the MCC dismissed the US Agent’s Second Petition for Rehearing. The Umpire reasoned: “[A.] [The] only questions now to be dealt with are those raised by the submission of new evidence, and the Commission, accordingly, will not re-examine the findings of fact made in its original decision of October 16, 1930, unless the Commission decides that it has jurisdiction to reopen these cases and the new evidence now submitted requires reversal or modification of such findings of fact. […] [B.] The American Commissioner and the German Commissioner have been unable to agree upon the decision of the questions presented in these cases as aforesaid, and their respective opinions having been stated to the Umpire they accordingly certify the above mentioned cases and all the questions arising under the supplemental petition therein to the Umpire of the Commission for decision, except that the German Commissioner takes the position that the question of the jurisdiction of the Commission to re-examine any case after a final decision has been rendered is not a proper question to be certified to the Umpire on disagreement of the National Commissioners and reserves that question from this certificate. […] [C.] A glance through this translation will indicate that, without reference to any other evidence, it is conclusive proof to any reasonable man that (a) Herrmann and Hilken knew […] the Black Tom explosion [was] the work of German agents and (b) that Hinsch, Hilken, and Herrmann, undoubted agents, were privy thereto, and […] (c) that Kristoff [was active participant]. […]. I may utterly disregard all the new evidence produced and still, if I deem this message genuine, hold Germany responsible […]. [But the] authenticity of the message is sharply challenged. […] [D.] As respects the production of the [Herrmann] message, I find that it comes from a source which the Commission has held unworthy of belief, and under circumstances which at least cause me to hesitate to give full faith and credit to the account of its discovery. […] [E.] The magazine [containing the Herrmann-Message] was produced by Paul Hilken […]. The document comes, therefore, from a source which the former opinion of the Commission entirely discredited. Hilken, though an American citizen, is a former German agent. His attitude at first was that of loyalty to Germany. In December, 1928, he changed his position and testified at great length on behalf of the claimants. […] In an affidavit made November 15, 1932, Hilken states that on Christmas Day, 1930, he made a search of the attic of his old home in Baltimore and unearthed the magazine at the bottom of a wooden box in a closet under the eaves, and at the same time discovered a large amount of correspondence bearing on his wartime activities. Apparently none of this other matter was delivered to the claimants with the magazine, but was filed with a later affidavit of Hilken dated June 29, 1931. Along with Hilken’s affidavit of November 15, 1932, were filed affidavits bearing date November 12 and 15, by Mrs. Hilken. Hilken’s daughter, and Elizabeth Braun. […] [F.] Elizabeth Braun, who is in no way identified to the Commission, […] says that Hilken told her of the finding of an important message and described it; she does not say that she saw it. All of these witnesses seem to have communicated the contents of their affidavits to the claimants during early or late 1931, but their testimony was not submitted to the Commission until November 15,1932. Hilken, […] gives as his reason for not promptly producing the message on its discovery, that he feared publicity as he knew that certain articles were being prepared on the sabotage cases to appear in the Liberty magazine. As respects the production of the message, I find that it comes from a source which the Commission has held unworthy of belief, and under circumstances which at least cause me to hesitate to give full faith and credit to the account of its discovery. […] [G.] [E]nough has been said to show in how extraordinary a manner this document dovetails with all the important and disputed points of claimants’ case and how pat all these references are, not to the request for funds but to the claimants’ points of proof, — this aside from the absurdity of sending this unnecessary information into an enemy country to a suspected spy then under surveillance. […] [H.] As it is my opinion that if the new evidence were formally placed on file and considered in connection with the whole body of evidence submitted prior to the Commission’s opinion of October 16, 1930, the findings then made and the conclusions then reached would not be reversed or materially modified, the question as to our jurisdiction need not be answered. The supplemental petition for rehearing is dismissed.”</p></div>

<div class="para-block" id="para-60"><span class="para-num">60.</span><p>On 15 December 1933, the MCC decided on the US Agent’s Third Petition for Rehearing in the Sabotage Claims based on further new evidence which should proof that the MCC had been misled by fraud and collusion on the part of witnesses and suppression of evidence. Following the Commissioners’ disagreement, the Umpire decided to sustain the Petition. The Umpire reasoned: “[A.] No tribunal worthy its name or of any respect may allow its decision to stand if such allegations are well-founded. Every tribunal has inherent power to reopen and to revise a decision induced by fraud. If it may correct its own errors and mistakes, a fortiori it may, while it still has jurisdiction of a cause, correct errors into which it has been led by fraud and collusion. [B.] I am of opinion, therefore, that the Commission has power to reopen these cases, and should do so in order that it may consider the further evidence tendered by the American Agent and, dependent upon its findings from that evidence and any that may be offered in reply on behalf of Germany, either confirm the decisions heretofore made or alter them as justice and right may demand.”</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-61"><span class="para-num">61.</span><p>On 24 March 1934, Germany appointed Victor Huecking as new German Commissioner to the MCC. Mr. Kiesselbach had previously resigned, possibly under pressure from the National Socialist German government.</p></div>

<div class="para-block" id="para-65"><span class="para-num">65.</span><p>On 10 June 1939, the German Chargé d’Affaires to the USA, Hans Thomsen, stated Germany’s position on the further proceedings in the MCC in a letter to the US Secretary of State: “As the German Agent […] reports, a written notice from the American Secretary of the Commission, according to which the Commission will hold a meeting at II a.m. on June 15th […], was received by him on June 7th, of this year. By direction of my Government, I call attention to the fact that since the withdrawal of the German Commissioner, […], of which I notified the American Government by a note to your Excellency of March 24th of this year, the Commission has been incompetent to make decisions and that consequently […] there is no legal basis for a meeting of the Commission at this stage. By direction of my Government, I advise you that [it] will ignore the decision to call the meeting on June 15th, as well as any other act of the Commission that might take place in violation of the International Agreement of August 10, 1922 and the generally established rules of procedure.”</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-66"><span class="para-num">66.</span><p>On 15 June 1939, the truncated MCC consisting of US Commissioner Garnett and Umpire Roberts rendered its Award holding Germany liable in the Sabotage Claims: “[A.] By reference to the Summary and Conclusions on the Question of Fraud […], it will be ascertained that the pleadings filed on behalf of Germany were false, and were known to be false, in claiming that Germany had never authorized sabotage in neutral countries nor in the United States during its neutrality, and in claiming that, though men and material for sabotage were sent to the United States in 1916, definite instructions had been given limiting and prohibiting activity until the time when the United States should enter the war. […] In order to substantiate Germany’s false pleadings Hinsch made many false statements upon which the Commission relied in its opinions. In order to attack the Herrmann message, he was guilty of the basest forms of prevarication, and upon these the Commission relied in its decisions [in 1930 and] in 1932. […] [B.] [In its decision in 1932], the Commission was unanimously of opinion that, if the authenticity of the Herrmann message be accepted, this would conclusively prove the liability of Germany […]. The final conclusions in these cases, therefore, may be stated as follows: [C.] (1) The decision of October 16, 1930 […] must be set aside, revoked and annulled; and the cases reinstated in the position they were before that decision was rendered. (2) Since the authenticity of the Herrmann message has been established, the liability of Germany in […] the Black Tom case […] has now been clearly established by the record […].”</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-67"><span class="para-num">67.</span><p>As to the procedural questions, Mr. Roberts stated the following: “1. Within the meaning and intent of the agreement by which the Commission was constituted and its powers defined, there exists a disagreement between the two national commissioners. As I participated with them in the conferences after submission of the cases, I am cognizant of the disagreement, which makes it my duty to act in the decision of the cases. […] Accordingly I record my opinion as Umpire.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-2"><span class="para-num">2.</span><p>I concur in the views expressed by the American Commissioner to the effect that the withdrawal of the German Commissioner, after submission by the parties, and after the tribunal, having taken the cases under advisement, pursuant to its rules, was engaged in the task of deciding the issues presented, did not oust the jurisdiction of the Commission. […] I hold that the Commission as now constituted has jurisdiction to decide the pending motions.”</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-68"><span class="para-num">68.</span><p>On 3 October 1939, Mr. Thomsen reacted to the award: “[A.] The German Government regrets all the more to have to make protests against this procedure, because the [MCC] could look back upon a model success in working, which had been made possible by confidential and friendly collaboration […]. It is characteristic of the spirit […] that the claims of the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company arising out of the explosion at the Black Tom Terminal […] were admitted into the proceedings before the [MCC] only because […] of voluntary admission by the German Government, after delay in submission. The German Government could have decisively excluded any discussion of these claims by referring to their delayed submission and the incompetence of the Commission arising therefrom. […] [B.] In order that no doubt may arise as to the view of the German Government, it is emphasized that in none of its communications has it taken the stand that by the withdrawal of the German Commissioner the Commission has become ‘functus officio’ and has thereby lost its competence. The sole conclusive question here is whether during the vacancy in the position of the German Commissioner the American Commissioner, whether alone or jointly with the American Umpire, can exercise functions which the governmental agreement has entrusted to the two National Commissioners for joint exercise. […] [C.] [T]he acts and orders of the American Umpire and the American Commissioner since March 1, 1939, among them the reopening of the proceedings in the Black Tom and Kingsland cases, the ‘decision’ of the Umpire and the American Commissioner on the responsibility of Germany in both cases, and the arbitrary granting of awards by the American Umpire, are null and void. Any awards which the American Umpire and the American Commissioner might issue on the basis of these measures are likewise null and void.”</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-69"><span class="para-num">69.</span><p>On 30 October 1939, the MCC determined the final sum of damages in the Sabotage Claims. The claim of LVRR was granted in the amount of $ 9,900,322. This sum included the $ 984,104.62 paid by LVRR to the Russian claimant in the litigation. With interest at 5 % this amounted to $ 21,396,444. This would be the MCC’s last decision. Since 1923, it had dealt with 20,433 claims, of which it recognised 7,025.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-70"><span class="para-num">70.</span><p>In January 1941, the US Treasury Department began paying out the sum awarded to LVRR. Germany had refused to pay and the remaining sum of the German funds available to the US Treasury Department in the framework of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 did not cover the whole award. Therefore, LVRR received only a sum significantly below the amount awarded in the MCC’s award of 30 October 1939. For purposes of the Moot, the participants are to assume that LVRR received exactly $ 9,900,322 corresponding to LVRR’s main claim without interest.</p></div>

<div class="para-block" id="para-79"><span class="para-num">79.</span><p>On 25 June 1941, the USA filed its Response to the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 2.1, 2.3 of the LCIA Arbitration Rules. The USA nominated Christopher Garnett as arbitrator. In addition, the USA raised the following preliminary objections: i. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction ratione personae under the Protocol. The Claimant is a U.S. national. ii. Claimant’s claim is an abuse of process. Claimant’s alleged subsidiary has received a final and binding award against Germany in the MCC proceedings. Claimant does not have a right to seek a second award – 25 years after the Black Tom Explosion – rather than trying to enforce the first award against Germany. iii. Under the applicable international law on diplomatic protection, Claimant’s alleged claim must furthermore be precluded because the USA was asked to provide and did provide diplomatic protection in representing LVRR against Germany before the MCC regarding the identical facts now invoked again by LVRR’s shareholder. iv. The explosion at the Black Tom pier was a sovereign act of the German military as confirmed in the MCC’s award of 15 June 1939 on which Claimant itself appears to rely for the determination of its financial losses. Article 2 (2) Protocol does not protect from foreign military acts during times of war. v. Mr. Hilken’s statements made in the MCC proceedings and the Herrmann Message must be excluded from the record of the present arbitration. Following the MCC’s final award in 1939, doubts were raised about the truthfulness of Mr. Hilken’s statements. The USA are not in a position to disclose more because this matter concerns sensitive information from its intelligence services. For the present arbitration, it is decisive that only statements of witnesses who testify before the Tribunal are admissive. Mr. Hilken, however, is unwilling to testify as he confirmed towards representatives of the USA. Since his unwillingness is not based on a valid reason (such as serious health issues), his statements cannot be relied on by the Tribunal. With his statements struck from the record, the authenticity of the Herrmann Message is not established. vi. Claimant’s claim must be dismissed in full because of Claimant’s refusal to submit a damages valuation by an independent forensic valuation expert. The determination of LVRR’s losses by the MCC cannot be binding on the present Tribunal. This determination was made in a different arbitration, on a different legal basis, and between different parties. In investment arbitration, claimants cannot escape their burden of proof by referring to alleged financial difficulties. vii. The sum of which Claimant claims 5 % before this Tribunal equals the interest awarded by the MCC. If the Tribunal were to hold Respondent liable under the Protocol (quod non), the interest would have to be significantly lower because Respondent would only have to pay the rate of its own ten-year government bonds as of today. viii. Claimant has no legal basis for its alleged claim that Respondent should indemnify against alleged claims of the Soviet Union. This indemnification claim goes beyond Article 2 (2) Protocol and the limits of established principles of causation. Even if arguendo the Tribunal holds otherwise, the judgment was paid to the correct recipient. Alleged claims of the Soviet Union against their citizens are of no concerns for the USA’s obligations under the Protocol.</p></div>

<div class="para-block" id="para-81"><span class="para-num">81.</span><p>On 11 August 1941, Claimant delivered to the Arbitral Tribunal and Respondent his written election to have his request treated as his Statement of Case pursuant to Art. 15.2 of the LCIA Arbitration Rules.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-82"><span class="para-num">82.</span><p>On 3 September 1941, Respondent delivered to the Arbitral Tribunal and Claimant its written election to have its response treated as its Statement of Defence pursuant to Art. 15.3 of the LCIA Arbitration Rules.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-83"><span class="para-num">83.</span><p>On 23 September 1941, Claimant delivered to the Arbitral Tribunal and Respondent a written Statement of Reply pursuant to Art. 15.4 of the LCIA Arbitration Rules. Claimant stated as follows: i. Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction ratione personae is unfounded. It is undisputed that Claimant was a Russian national when the consent to arbitrate was perfected. This is the decisive point in time for jurisdiction. Even if the Tribunal holds otherwise (quod non), under the applicable principles of international law, it cannot be held against Claimant that he was de-naturalized by the Soviet Union in violation of international law. He acquired the U.S. nationality only to avoid being stateless. Claimant still considers himself Russian. ii. Claimant’s claim is the opposite of an abuse of process. First, until 1941, Claimant had been waiting in good faith for the USA to resolve the situation through representing LVRR adequately before the MCC and assisting with enforcement. The USA has not fulfilled this mandate adequately. Second, as a mere 5 % foreign shareholder, Claimant has limited influence over LVRR’s decision-making. Third, given the currently ongoing World War II, Claimant cannot be referred to chasing German assets abroad. For these reasons, Claimant chose to bring this claim under the BIT. This claim is Claimant’s self-standing right. iii. Under international law, LVRR’s choice to bring the claim before the MCC cannot preclude Claimant’s rights under the BIT. First, the measure invoked in violation of the BIT is the USA’s failure to prevent the July 1916 explosion, not the USA’s failure to afford diplomatic protection properly (which the USA has not). Second, the rights under the BIT are Claimant’s rights, not LVRR’s rights. Third, LVRR’s choice to bring the Claim before the MCC did not require Claimant’s consent because Claimant owns only 5 %. iv. Contrary to Respondent, Article 2 (2) BIT entails an obligation of the host State to protect investors from foreign acts of war. That the BIT applies in times of war is already evident from Article 9 (1) BIT which applies in addition to, not instead of Article 2 (2) BIT. v. Respondent’s allegations against the Herrmann Message must be rejected. First of all, it is remarkable that Respondent is implying that it adduced false testimony from Mr. Hilken, used it actively before the MCC, but should be able to evade this evidence before the present Tribunal. Furthermore, Claimant did not submit a witness statement of Mr. Hilken but documentary records. In international arbitration, documents need not be submitted through a witness statement. Finally, Respondent itself has the authority to order Mr. Hilken (who continues to live in the USA) to testify. Respondent cannot benefit from its own unwillingness to do so. vi. The determination of LVRR’s losses by the MCC should be binding or, to the least, persuasive to the Tribunal. The determinative factor is whether the Respondent in the present case (the USA) had an adequate opportunity to influence this determination. The USA had such opportunity because before the MCC, the USA represented its nationals and made the final strategic decisions on argumentations. The USA has no adequate grounds to re-argue this matter. If the Tribunal considers it necessary (quod non), it has, at any time, the power to appoint an expert (which should then be paid out of the advance on costs paid by Respondent because Claimant is unable to make further advances). vii. Contrary to Respondent, this Tribunal need not be bothered with calculating interest again. First, the $ 9,900,322 enforced in January 1941 must be counted against the outstanding interest, not the main claim of LVRR. Second, in any case, the interest of 5 % applied by the MCC was adequate because pre-award interest must compensate for the claimant’s inability to re-invest the money. Third, the interest rate of Respondent’s ten-year Government bonds at the time of the breach was only marginally lower than 5 %. viii. Under the final and binding judgment of Respondent’s own courts, LVRR had to pay $ 984,104.62 to the “State of Russia” represented by Serge Ughet. Therefore, LVRR saw no option other than to make payment to Russia’s last remaining representative in the USA. This payment and the Soviet Union’s alleged claims against Claimant have all been caused by Respondent’s failure to adequately protect Claimant from foreign espionage attacks. Therefore, Claimant must be able to claim indemnity. The latter is nothing more than a means of full reparation. ix. Finally, Claimant must, with a heavy heart, file its challenge of Mr. Christopher Garnett under Article 10.3 of the LCIA Rules. Only one week ago, Claimant’s Counsel has learnt through conversations with Richard Paulig, the German Agent in the MCC from 1934 to 1939, that Mr. Garnett has served as Commissioner in the MCC. First, this fact had been unknown to Claimant. For the avoidance of doubt, LVRR did not send Claimant copies of the MCC’s awards. Second, Mr. Garnett has knowledge of case materials superior to the other two co- arbitrators. Already therefore, he cannot serve in the present Tribunal. Above all, Respondent itself is challenging the evidentiary value of the Herrmann Message and Mr. Hilken’s testimony on new grounds. It is inconceivable that one of the arbitrators has already addressed these matters while the others have not. Third, as US Commissioner in the MCC, Mr. Garnett received in excess of what is permissible as repeat appointments by a party.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-84"><span class="para-num">84.</span><p>On 3 October 1941, Respondent replied as follows to the challenge: ix. Claimant’s challenge must be rejected by the two unchallenged arbitrators under Article 10 (3) BIT. First, under Article 10.3 sentence 1 LCIA Rules, the challenge is time-barred. It has been in the public domain for a long time that Mr. Garnett was US Commissioner in the MCC from 1936 onwards. Second, Mr. Garnett’s knowledge of the case record in the MCC will benefit the Tribunal Third, Mr. Garnett had not received repeat appointments, but one appointment by the US, i.e. the one appointment to the MCC.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-85"><span class="para-num">85.</span><p>On 27 October 1941, the Tribunal holds its oral hearing on the Respondent’s preliminary objections and the Claimant’s challenge of Respondent’s appointee.</p></div>

                    <p>Protocol on the Mutual Encouragement and Protection of Investment Protocol to the Treaty on Friendship, Navigation and Commerce between the Russian Empire and the United States of America</p>
<p>The Russian Empire and The United States of America, hereinafter referred to as the Contracting Parties, Desiring to strengthen their traditional ties of friendship and to extend and intensify the economic relations between them, particularly with respect to investments by the nationals of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, Recognising that treaty upon the treatment to be accorded to such investments will stimulate the flow of capital and technology and the economic development of the Contracting Parties and the cooperation on navigation issues, Have agreed as follows:</p>
<p>2 Article 1 For the purposes of this Agreement: (1) the term “investments” means every kind of asset and more particularly, though not exclusively: (a)    movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem in respect of every kind of asset; (b)    rights derived from shares, bonds and other kinds of interests in companies and joint ventures; (c)   claims to money, to other assets or to any performance having an economic value; (d)    rights granted under public law or under contract, including rights to prospect, explore, extract and win natural resources. (2)    the term “nationals” shall comprise with regard to either Contracting Party: (a)    natural persons having the nationality of that Contracting Party; (b)    legal persons constituted under the law of that Contracting Party; (c)    legal persons not constituted under the law of that Contracting Party but controlled, directly or indirectly, by natural persons as defined in (a) or by legal persons as defined in (b). Article 2 (1) Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable conditions for investors of the other Contracting Party to make investments in its territory and shall admit such investments, in accordance with its laws and regulations. (2) Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Article 3 Each Contracting Party shall accord to investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party treatment which in any case shall not be less favourable than that accorded either to investments of its own nationals or to investments of nationals of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the national concerned. Article 4</p>
<p>3 If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by nationals of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such regulation shall, to the extent that it is more favourable, prevail over the present Agreement. Article 5 Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party. Article 6 With respect to taxes, fees, charges and to fiscal deductions and exemptions, each Contracting Party shall accord to nationals of the other Contracting Party who are engaged in any economic activity in its territory, treatment not less favourable than that accorded to its own nationals or to those of any third State who are in the same circumstances, whichever is more favourable to the nationals concerned. For this purpose, however, there shall not be taken into account any special fiscal advantages accorded by that Party: a)     under an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation; or b)     by virtue of its participation in a customs union, economic union or similar institution; or c)     on the basis of reciprocity with a third State. Article 7 The Contracting Parties shall guarantee that payments relating to an investment may be transferred. The transfers shall be made in a freely convertible currency, without restriction or delay. Such transfers include in particular though not exclusively: a)     profits, interests, dividends and other current income; b)     funds necessary : (i)    for the acquisition of raw or auxiliary materials, semi-fabricated or finished products, or (ii)    to replace capital assets in order to safeguard the continuity of an investment; c)     additional funds necessary for the development of an investment; d)     funds in repayment of loans; e)     royalties or fees;</p>
<p>4 f)     earnings of natural persons; g)     the proceeds of sale or liquidation of the investment; h)     payments arising under Article 9. Article 8 Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or indirectly, nationals of the other Contracting Party of their investments unless the following conditions are complied with: a)     the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law; b)     the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking which the Contracting Party which takes such measures may have given; c)     the measures are taken against just compensation. Such compensation shall represent the genuine value of the investments affected, shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment and shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable, without delay, to the country designated by the claimants concerned and in the currency of the country of which the claimants are nationals or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants. Art. 9 (1) Except where Article 8 applies, an Investor of a Contracting Party which suffers a loss with respect to any Investment in the Area of the other Contracting Party owing to war or other armed conflict, state of national emergency, civil disturbance, or other similar event in that Area, shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, treatment which is the most favourable of that which that Contracting Party accords to any other Investor, whether its own Investor or the Investor of any third state. (2) Without prejudice to paragraph (1), an Investor of a Contracting Party which, in any of the situations referred to in that paragraph, suffers a loss in the Area of the other Contracting Party resulting from (a) requisitioning of its Investment or part thereof by the latter’s forces or authorities; or (b) destruction of its Investment or part thereof by the latter’s forces or authorities, which was not required by the necessity of the situation, shall be accorded restitution or compensation which in either case shall be prompt, adequate and effective.</p>
<h3 class="doc-article"><span class="article-num">Article 10</span></h3>
<p>5 (1) Any dispute which may arise between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment on the territory of that other Contracting Party shall be subject to negotiations between the Parties in dispute. (2) If any dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party can not be thus settled within a period of three months, the investor shall be entitled to submit the case to an arbitrator or international ad hoc arbitral tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) or the Arbitration Rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA). The arbitral awards shall be final and binding on both Parties to the Dispute. (3) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for resolution under subparagraph (2), the following rules apply: a. The arbitral tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators. Each party shall appoint one arbitrator. b. The decision on any proposal to disqualify an arbitrator shall be taken by the other members of the arbitral tribunal, provided that where those members are equally divided, the rules otherwise applicable apply. c. A proposal to disqualify an arbitrator shall not result in a suspension of the arbitral proceedings. d. The UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration apply. Article 11 The provisions of this Agreement shall, from the date of entry into force thereof, also apply to investments which have been made before that date. Article 12 Either Contracting Party may propose to the other Party that consultations be held on any matter concerning the interpretation or application of the Agreement. The other Party shall accord sympathetic consideration to the proposal and shall afford adequate opportunity for such consultations. Article 13 (1) Any dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of the present Agreement, which cannot be settled within a reasonable lapse of time by means of diplomatic negotiations, shall, unless the Parties have otherwise agreed, be submitted, at the request of either Party, to an arbitral tribunal, composed of three members. Each Party shall appoint one arbitrator and the two arbitrators thus appointed shall together appoint a third arbitrator as their chairman who is not a national of either Party.</p>
<p>6 (2) If one of the Parties fails to appoint its arbitrator and has not proceeded to do so within two months after an invitation from the other Party to make such appointment, the latter Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointment. (3) If the two arbitrators are unable to reach agreement, in the two months following their appointment, on the choice of the third arbitrator, either Party may invite the President of the International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointment. (4) If, in the cases provided for in the paragraphs (2) and (3) of this Article, the President of the International Court of Justice is prevented from discharging the said function or is a national of either Contracting Party, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the Vice-President is prevented from discharging the said function or is a national of either Party the most senior member of the Court available who is not a national of either Party shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. (5) The tribunal shall decide on the basis of respect for the law. Before the tribunal decides, it may at any stage of the proceedings propose to the Parties that the dispute be settled amicably. The foregoing provisions shall not prejudice settlement of the dispute ex aequo et bono if the Parties so agree. (6) Unless the Parties decide otherwise, the tribunal shall determine its own procedure. (7) The tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes. Such decision shall be final and binding on the Parties. Article 14 (1) The present Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following the date on which the Contracting Parties have notified each other in writing that their constitutionally required procedures have been complied with, and shall remain in force for a period of forty years. (2) Unless notice of termination has been given by either Contracting Party at least six months before the date of the expiry of its validity, the present Agreement shall be extended tacitly for periods of ten years, whereby each Contracting Party reserves the right to terminate the Agreement upon notice of at least six months before the date of expiry of the current period of validity. (3) In respect of investments made before the date of the termination of the present Agreement, the foregoing Articles shall continue to be effective for a further period of fifteen years from that date. (4) Subject to the period mentioned in paragraph (2) of this Article, the Russian Empire shall be entitled to terminate the application of the present Agreement separately in respect of any of the parts of the Empire.</p>

Notice of his purpose to move for such dismissal shall be given by the American Agent to the claimant if his address is known and also to the claimant's attorney, if he is represented by an attorney; but if the address only of the claimant or only of the attorney is known the notice to the one whose address is known will be a sufficient compliance with this rule. Such notice shall be sent by registered mail at least two weeks prior to the filing of the motion by the American Agent for a dismissal of the claim: Provided, That if the address of either the claimant or his attorney is without the continental United States the notice shall be mailed at least six weeks prior to the filing of such motion for dismissal. Such motion shall be supported by proof that such evidence has been requested and that the notice to the claimant and/or his attorney as herein provided for has been given. Such proof shall consist of copies of letters sent by the American Agent to the claimant and/or his attorney requesting proof or additional proof in support of the claim and of a receipt for the registered mail giving notice that motion will be made for a dismissal of the claim.</p>

<p>Late claims The rules of the Commission as they now exist shall govern the preparation, presentation, and adjudication of all claims coming before the Commission by virtue of the said supplementary agreement (hereinafter designed " late claims") 1 Amendment adopted January 22, 1924 (Order No. 24). 2 Amendment adopted February 6, 1929, the text of the order being as follows: "Whereas the Mixed Claims Commission, United States and Germany, has been established and exists in pursuance of the agreement between the United States and Germany dated August 10, I 922; and "Whereas the jurisdiction of the said Commission has been extended by virtue of an agreement between the Government of the United States and the Government of Germany evidenced by an exchange of notes dated December 31, 1928 (hereinafter referred to as 'supplementary agreement'); and " Whereas by virtue of the said supplementary agreement the said Commission is given jurisdiction over certain ' late claims of American nationals against Germany ' described therein; "Now, therefore, in order that the procedure of the Commission may conform to and that the terms of the said supplementary agreement may be speedily carried into effect in accordance with its true intent and purpose, the present rules of the said Commission are hrreby amended by adding thereto rule XIV as follows : ".</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>save as the said rules are superseded or modified by the provisions of this rule XIV, which shall apply only to such late claims. Section ]. On or before July, 3 I I 929, each of the said late claims shall be pre­ sented to the Commission by the American Agent. Such presentation shall be in one of the following forms: (a) A Memorial together with all supporting evidence; (b) A statement signed by the American Agent that the claim submitted is for a loss or damage which in his opinion is not within the jurisdiction of the Commission. The American Agent may submit one or more claims under one statement. The German Agent need not join in such submission. (c) A motion to dismiss signed by the American Agent supported by the original papers in any case in which the American Agent has, by registered mail, requested the claimant, or his attorney, to furnish proof in support of such claim within a specified time and in which the claimant, or his attorney, has failed to furnish the proof requested within said time, or in any case in which the claimant, or his attorney, has advised the American Agent that the claimant does not desire to have his claim further prosecuted. (d) An agreed statement of facts signed by the American and German Agents in substantial accordance with rule XI of the Commission. Section 2. Prior to the presentation of a claim under section I hereof, the American Agent may file a preliminary submission of a claim with a memorial accompanied by all evidence then available. On or before July, 31 1929, all such claims shall be presented to the Commission under the provisions of section I. Upon filing a pre­ liminary submission of the claim under this section, the American Agent shall, whenever the evidence in support of the claim is complete, serve notice upon the German Agent to the effect that he has filed all of the direct evidence he desires to submit in support of the claim. The German Agent shall admit service of such notice, and the original of said notice with such admission shall be filed with the Joint Secretaries. The service of said notice upon the German Agent shall consti­ tute a presentation of the claim to the Commission under the provisions of section I (a) hereof. Section 3. Within six months from the presentation of a claim by the American Agent, as provided in Section I hereof, the German Agent shall file with the Joint Secretaries such answer of the German Government, together with all evidence in support thereof, as he may desire to file. Section 4. Within thirty days after the filing of an answer by the German Agent to any claim, the American Agent may file with the Joint Secretaries further evi­ dence which shall be strictly limited to evidence in rebuttal of that submitted by the German Agent. Evidence which is merely cumulative of that previously filed by the American Agent shall not be filed by the American Agent subsequent to July 31, 1929, or subsequent to the filing of the answer and supporting evidence of the Ger­ man Agent. The Commission may, for good cause shown, extend the time for filing rebuttal evidence by the American Agent. Section 5. After the American Agent has given notice of the filing of all of the direct evidence which he desires to file in any claim, or after July, 31 1929, the German Agent may at his election demur to the claim as presented by the American Agent as insufficient in law, after which no evidence may be filed by either party, and the claim shall be submitted to and disposed of by the Commission on the record as it then stands.</p>
<p>9 Section 6. \,\Ii thin ten days from the filing of an agreed statement, or a demurrer by the German Agent, or within ten days from the filing of rebuttal evidence by the American Agent or from the expiration of the time for filing rebuttal evidenceè either Agent may file with the Joint Secretaries a statement in writing indicating that he desires to file a brief in supporl of or in opposition to such claim. All briefa filed shall concisely present in logical sequence the propositions relied upon and ;hall be restricted to the issue or issues of fact and/or of law raised by the claim as presented by the American Agent and the answer or demurrer of the German Agent. Should the American Agent desire to file such brief it shall be filed within thirty days from the date of the filing of the answer or demurrer of the German Agent. Should the German Agent desire to file such brief it shall be filed within thirty days from (a) the date of the filing by the American Agent of his declared purpose not to file a brief or (b) the date of the filing of a brief by the American Agent. Neither Agent shall file more than one brief unless authorized so to do by formal order entered by the Commission. Sectiorz 7. A claim shall be held to be finally submitted to the Commission (a) upon the expiration of the time within which briefs may be filed as provided in Section 6 hereof; (b) upon the filing of briefs in accordance with Section 6 hereof (c) upon the failure of either Agent to present a pleading, evidence, or brief within the time limits herein before provided; and (d) upon the filing of a statement or motion by the American Agent in accordance with subdivisiom (b) or (c) of Section l hereof.</p>

Held also that Commission, like all international arbitral tribunals, haſ exclusive and final power to determine, according to applicable international law, in whom cause of action originally vests, as well as to determine all other questions involving its validity and the amount recoverable, but that all questions involvin1a; transfer of interest from and through original owner must be decided by municipal tribunals according to local jurisprudence.

PARKER, Umpire, delivered the opinion of the Commission, the American Commissioner and the German Commissioner concurring in the conclusions: For the guidance of the American Agent and the German Agent and their respective counsel there are here set down some of the basic principles which will, so far as applicable, control the preparation. presentation, and decision of all cases submitted to the Commission. Reference is made to Administrative Decision No. I for the definition of terms used herein. Functions of Commission. This Commission was established and exists in pursuance of the terms of the Agreement between the United States and Germany dated August 10, 1922. Here are found the source of, and limitations upon, the Commission's powers and jurisdiction in the discharge of its task of determining the amount to be paid by Germany in satisfaction of her financial obligations to the United States and to American nationals under the Treaty of Berlin. Article I of the Agreement provides that: "The commission shall pass upon the following categories of claims which are more particularly defined in the Treaty of August 25, 192 l. and in the Treaty of Versailles: "(l) Claims of American citizens, arising since July 31, 1914, in respect of damage to, or seizure of, their property, rights and interests, including any company or association in which they are interested, within German territory as it existed on August l, 1914; "(2) Other claims for loss or damage to which the United States or its nationals have been subjected with respect to injuries to persons, or to property, rights and interests, including any company or association in which American nationals are interested, since July 31, 1914, as a consequence of the war; "(3) Debts owing to American citizens by the German Government or by German nationals.'' The financial obligations of Germany which this Commission is empowered to determine arise out of claims presented by the United States falling within the several categories specified in the Agreement and more particularly defined or described in the Treaty of Berlin. For this more particular definition as applied to claims (other than excepted claims) against Germany asserted by the United States on behalf of its nationals reference is made to the decision of the Umpire as embraced in the Commission's Administrative Decision No. I.</p>
<p>3 The Commission is not concerned with the Treaty of \'ersailles as such, but only with those of its proviƠions which have been incorporated by reference into the Treaty of Berlin. While for convenient designation reference will be made herein to the Treaty of Versailles, it will be understood (unless the context plainly indicates the contrary) that such reference is to such of the pre­ visions of the Treaty of Versailles as constitute a part of the Treaty of Berlin. The machinery provided by the Treaty of Versailles and the rules and methods of procedure thereunder governing the disposition of claims may be applied by but are not binding on this Commission. It does not, of course, follow that every ''claim" presented to the Commission constitutes a "financial obligation" of Gem1any. The American Agent pursues the policy of giving American nationals the benefit of every doubt and presents all claims that are not frivolous. Therefore at the threshold of the consideration of each claim is presented the question of jurisdiction, which obviously the Commission must determine preliminarily to fixing the amount of Germany's financial obligations, if any. in each case. 1 \Vhen the allegations in a petition or memorial presented by the United States bring a claim within the terms of the Treaty, the jurisdiction of the Commission attaches. If these allegations are controverted in whole or in part by Germany, the issue thus made must be decided by the Commission. Should the Commission so decide such issue that the claim does not fall within the terms of the Treaty. it will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. But if such issue be so decided that the claim does fall within the terms of the Treaty, then the Commission will prescribe the measure of damages, apply such measure to the facts in the particular case as the Commission may find them, and fix the financial obligation of Germany therein. The Commission's task is to apply the terms of the Treaty of Berlin to each case presented, decide those which it holds are within its jurisdiction, and dismiss all others. The Commission is not concerned with the payment by Germany of its financial obligations arising under the Treaty. Its task is confined solely to fixing the amount of such financial obligations. Principles governing Commission. In its adjudications the Commission will be controlled by the termơ of the Treaty of Berlin. \Vhere no applicable provision is found in that instrument, in determining the me;:,sure of damages the Commission may apply: 2 1 "History and Digest of the International Arbitrations to which the United States Has Been a Party," by John Bassett Moore, 1898 (hereinafter cited as "Moore's Arbitrations"): Volume I, pages 324-'.127, Volume III, Chapter LII, pages 2277- 2312, and page 2599; "International Law Chiefly as Interpreted and Applied by the United States," by Charles Cheney Hyde, 1922 (hereinafter cited as "Hyde") section 577 (Volume II, page 153) and authorities cited in notes; "Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States," 1895, Part I, pages 83-84, letter from l\1r.

The United States is claimant. Though conducted in behalf of their respective citizens, governments are the real parties to international arbitrations. 3 All claims, therefore, presented to this Commission shall be asserted and controlled bv the United States as claimant, either on its own behalf or on behalf of one oƗ more of its nationals. If in the decisions, opinions. and proceedings of the Commission American nationals are referred to as claimants it will be under­ stood that this is for the purpose of convenient designation and that the Government of the United States is the actual claimant. Original and contznuou.s ownership of claim. In order to bring a claim ( other than a Government claim) within the jurisdiction of this Commission, the loss must have been suffered by an American national, and the claim for such loss must have since continued in American ownership.Ƙ The enquiry is: Was the United States, which is the claimant, injured through injury to its national? It was not so injured where the injured person was at the time of suffering the injury a citizen of another state. While natura­ lization transfers allegiance, it does not carry with it existing state obligations. Any other rule would convert a nation into a claim agent in behalf of those availing of its naturalization laws to become its citizens after suffering injury. 5 (Footnote cnn./mued [rum page 25.)

The language of the Treaty of Berlin does not bring a claim which America is presenting on behalf of its nationals within the exception to the general rule an­ nounced by Barge. Umpire, in the Orinoco Steamship Company Case, Venezuelan Arbitrations 1903, at pages 84-85. The rule here laid down will not preclude the presentation by the American Agent and the consideration by this Commission of the claims, if any, of citizens of the Virgin Islands and others similarly situated, who, after suffering damages through the act of Germany or her agents, became American nationals through the acquisition of territory by the United States and not on their own initiative. 4</p>
<p>Apportionment of awards amongst claimants. As above stated, 1t 1s the province of this Commission to adjudicate claims presented by the United States, on its own behalf and on behalf of its nationals, against Germany falling within the several categories defined or described in the Treaty of Berlin. The primary purpose of such adjudication is to determine the amount of Germany's financial obligations to the United States under the Treaty. 6 Obviously, Germany is concerned only with the amount of her obligations and not with any distribution which may be made by the United States of such amount when paid. But both Governments are directly interested in, and this Commission in passing upon its jurisdiction must determine, the ownership of each claim at and since its inception. In that class of claims where two or more are joined as claimants in one case because their respective causes of action are based upon a single occur­ rence, and where their demands are several rather than joint, this Commission must, after disposing of all jurisdictional questions, determine how much each claimant is entitled to recover before the aggregate amount of the award in that case can be fixed. To illustrate: Claims growing out of injuries resulting in death are not asserted on behalf of the estate of I he deceased, the award to be distributed according to the provisions of a will or any other fixed or arbitrary basis. The right to recover rests on the direct personal loss, if any, suffered by each of the claimants. All issues with respect to parties entitled to recover, as well as issues involving the measure of damages, are determined, not by the law of the domicile of the deceased, but in private or municipal jurisprudence by the law of the place where the tort was committed 7-here by the law of nations and the application of the governing principles above announced. The rules for measuring the damages suffered by each claimant are the same. But those rules must be separately applied to the circumstances and conditions, not only of the deceased but of each claimant as well, to arrive at the quantum of damages suffered by each claimant. This process necessarily involves a determination of the amount to be awarded each claimant rather than the aggregate amount of Germany's liability for the loss of a life. The problem in such cases is, not to distribute a given amount assessed against Germany amongst several persons, but to assess separately the damages suffered by each of such persons who jointly present independent claims. This the Commission will do. In so doing we are mindful of expressions used in the opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States to the effect that one claiming an award made by an international tribunal in favor of another is bound by the decision of such tribunal as to the validity of the claim and the amount of the award but ,wt as to the ownership the,eof 8 ' See Preamble to Agreement; Frelinghuysen v.

<p>October 16, 1930</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[1] These two cases involve claims for damages resulting from fires. The first relates to the fire which occurred on the night of July 29-30, 1916, at the terminal yard of the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company in New York harbor, known as the Black Tom Terminal, and is known as the Black Tom Case. The second relates to the destruction of the Kingsland plant of the Agency of Canadian Car and Foundry Company, Limited, at Kingsland, New Jersey, and is known as the Kingsland Case. This fire started in the late afternoon of January 11, 1917. The two cases have from the beginning been carried along together, both in the taking of the evidence and in the arguments. It will be convenient to deal with them in one opinion.</p>
<p>[2] The questions involved are questions of fact. Germany and the United States, now friendly nations, have entered into an agreement under which Germany accepts liability for such damage during neutrality to citizens of the United States, if the damage resulted from acts of her authorized agents.</p>
<p>[3] The Commission has no difficulty with the question of authority in these cases. The persons alleged to be responsible for causing these two fires to be set — either by participating in the act themselves or by employing sub-agents of their own — were in such relation to the German authorities, and some of them in such special relation to Nadolny and Marguerre, who were in charge of the Political Section of the German General Staff, or to Hinsch, that Germany must be held responsible if they, or some of them, did cause the fires to be set. The Commission does not need direct proof, but on the evidence as submitted we could hold Germany responsible if, but only if, we are reasonably convinced that the fires occurred in some way through the acts of certain German agents.</p>
<p>[4] We have no doubt that authority was so given by Marguerre in February, 1916. Marguerre himself so testifies. Nadolny had on January 26, 1915, sent a cable authorizing such sabotage. Nadolny in his evidence gives the impression that the policy was abandoned shortly after his cable. Marguerre testifies that the authority given by him in 1916 was not to be exercised during neutrality, but only in case the United States entered into the war. We do not believe his evidence with respect to this alleged limitation of the authority, though.</p>
<p>[5] It is well recognized that Governments who have agreed to arbitrate are under obligation in entire good faith to try to ascertain the real truth. Nadolny may have suppressed evidence as to his knowledge of the instructions given by Marguerre, and we think, though of course we may be mistaken, that Marguerre did not tell the truth. Nadolny’s examination was confined wholly to his cable, and the Marguerre instructions were not at that time a feature of the case. We cannot be sure of what Nadolny knew, and would not be willing without further evidence to accuse him, but we have felt it necessary to mention the possibility. It is also apparent that von Strempel of the German Legation in Chile, in another connection, failed to communicate to the Commission statements made to him by Herrmann, which tended strongly to cast doubt upon an affidavit of Herrmann which von Strempel was forwarding to the Commission, though it should be added that we can easily understand that von Strempel did not believe these boasting tales of Herrmann, who even then, apparently, did not admit complicity of himself or Hinsch in Black Tom or Kingsland. Marguerre’s personality does not seem important, but Nadolny and von Strempel are diplomatic representatives of Germany. Von Strempel was a young man, unfamiliar with the case, and probably did not fully realize his obligation as a diplomatic representative to the Commission and to his own Government.</p>
<p>[6] In speaking as we have of Nadolny, Marguerre, and von Strempel we have not the least intention to raise any doubt as to the entire good faith of the present German Government in its management and presentation of these cases, nor of the Agent who has represented Germany as counsel. And in order that this last statement may not be construed as merely conventional courtesy, we state specifically that we have no such doubts. We believe that the present German Government was entirely prepared to bring out the truth and to take the consequences, whatever they might be.</p>
<p>[7] It is unnecessary to go further and determine whether such sabotage was the general policy of the then German Government. The Foreign Office did specifically authorize the cable, already referred to, which Nadolny sent to the Embassy in Washington. We are inclined to think that the diplomatic representatives in the United States were not in accord with the idea and did nothing in the way of exercising this particular authority. There was an admitted policy to destroy and damage property of the nations at war with Germany at this time and later, and it is obvious that such acts if committed in or from the United States were serious violations of neutrality, that agents engaged therein were not likely to discriminate very carefully between acts on United States territory and acts outside the United States, or between property belonging to Germany’s enemies and property not yet delivered, but intended for Germany’s enemies. But in general we are all inclined to the opinion that Germany’s diplomatic representatives in the United States were averse to attacks on American property, that their opposition to such a policy, so far as they, possibly, knew or suspected that it was being carried out, became stronger as the relations between the United States and Germany became more and more acute. We see no evidence in these cases, however, that such authority as the Political Section of the General Staff gave was ever modified. And up to the entry of the United States into the war there were in the United States certain German agents who were, or at least pretended to be, active in sabotage work. But we are also convinced that the number of agents so engaged was always small in proportion to the field to be covered, that they were never organized effectively, and that their numbers and effectiveness continually decreased, partly because of difficulty of communicating with Germany and other difficulties inherent in their situation and even more</p>
<p>[8] because of efficient counter-work by the United States Secret Service and prosecuting officers. We are convinced also that their pretensions in such reports as they may have made and in their talk with each other were for the most part gross exaggerations of their actual accomplishments.</p>
<p>[9] With this background, which renders inferences against Germany easier than they would otherwise be, we approach the evidence as to the German agents and their alleged tools. We found ourselves absolutely in agreement as to this background upon our first consultation after the close of the arguments and before we had considered at all the responsibility of any of the German agents.</p>
<p>[10] These cases have been argued twice, the second argument having been necessitated by the production of new evidence. The second argument has occupied the most of ten days, and it has not been too long in view of the enormous record of evidence and the details which the counsel were obliged to cover. We have no intention of covering all these details in our opinion, but it seems desirable that we should indicate as briefly as possible our views as to some of the more prominent features of the evidence, although we will begin by stating our final conclusions, viz.:</p>
<p>[11] In the Kingsland Case we find upon the evidence that the fire was not caused by any German agent.</p>
<p>[12] In the Black Tom case we are not convinced that the fire was not attributable to Hinsch and Kristoff, though we are convinced that it was not attributable to Witzke or Jahnke. But we are quite a long way from being convinced that the fire was caused by any German agent.</p>
<p>[13] We therefore decide both cases in favor of Germany.</p>
<p>[14] In the Kingsland Case the persons possibly involved as participants are Witzke, Jahnke, Hinsch, Herrmann, Wozniak, Rodriguez, and Thorne. The evidence relating to Witzke and Jahnke is mainly in the shape of alleged admissions by Witzke and is intermingled with his alleged admissions in connection with the Black Tom Case. This evidence makes no impresson whatever upon us with respect to the Kingsland Case, but the fact that it does refer to the Kingsland fire as well as to the Black Tom fire tends to weaken the effect of the alleged admissions as to the Black Tom Case. On the evidence we are satisfied that Witzke and Jahnke were not in the east at the time of the Kingsland fire, and eliminate them from further consideration in connection with Kingsland.</p>
<p>[15] The Kingsland fire of January 11, 1917, started in a building devoted to the cleaning of shells. It started at the bench of a workman named Wozniak. The case against Germany in substance depends upon whether Wozniak started this fire, under Herrmann’s direction.</p>
<p>[16] Until Herrmann who was undoubtedly a German agent and had previously testified that he had nothing whatever to do with the Kingsland fire, changed his attitude and testified that he employed Wozniak to start the fire there was nothing from which we could reasonably infer either that Wozniak was a German agent or that he caused the fire. Hilken another German agent, since Herrmann changed his testimony, has testified that Herrmann told him long ago the same story that Herrmann now tells. Hinsch, the man whom Herrmann connects with himself in the story, has denied it. His denial contains plausible details, but we could not rely on it if we felt that Herrmann was now telling the truth, for though we have no evidence that Hinsch is a liar, there is a strong presumption that he might be under circumstances which pointed to his guilt.</p>
<p>[17] Hilken and Herrmann are both liars, not presumptive but proven. No one could in the light of all their evidence believe anything either says unless</p>
<p>[18] something other than his own assertion confirmed his statements. Hilken’s first long and detailed statement in these cases contained nothing of what he now says in respect to Kingsland. He had previously testified before the Alien Property Custodian and had lied continuously. In his first statement for the Commission he professes his willingness to tell the entire truth. If he did, there can be no truth either in his or Herrmann’s present story. Later he admits that he did not earlier tell the whole truth, and explains his failure to do so by his unwillingness to implicate others. But after this first testimony to the Commission he was sent by counsel for the claimants to Chile to persuade Herrmann to testify, in which mission he failed. On his return he made an affidavit covering his conversations in Chile with Herrmann. In this affidavit it is evident that he had no further desire to shield Herrmann, if he ever really had such a desire. He tells of various things which Herrmann said to him which he knew were not true, and pretends to tell what he knows to the contrary. But he says nothing about his knowledge of the story Herrmann now tells about Kingsland. If Hilken had not mentioned Kingsland in this affidavit, his present story would be more credible. But he says that he asked Herrmann about Kingsland and that Herrmann in Chile denied all knowledge of it. Instead of reporting that Herrmann had previously told him all about it, as he now testifies, he adds to Herrmann’s denial merely the statement that Herrmann had previously told him that he and one Gerdts once rode over to look at Kingsland after the fire.</p>
<p>[19] Herrmann’s present story has in its favor whatever presumption arises, even after repeated denials, from the fact that he is confessing his own participation in a crime of serious importance. We know also that some of the things he previously denied are true. We know, or at least believe, that he was authorized in Berlin by Marguerre to commit sabotage during neutrality, and we know that he was supplied by Marguerre with inflammatory devices in the form of pencils, containing glass tubes. Appropriately manipulated the chemicals in the tubes would mix after an interval of from 15 to 30 minutes and cause a flame. But his testimony now with respect to Kingsland and Black Tom is not at all that of a witness who for reasons of conscience desires to make a clean breast. Whether he now means to tell the truth or means to lie, he is testifying solely because of the fact that he has lost his position in Chile, that the German Government has not taken care of him, and that by testifying he has secured the chance to get back to the United States with a guaranty of immunity. We do not imply or think that anything improper was done to induce him to testify, merely that it is sufficiently obvious that Herrmann would not have turned his coat if the German Government or the German Legation in Chile had offered him appropriate inducements, and that having turned his coat because of advantage to himself he is pretty sure to be in a mental attitude in which hostility to Germany and desire to make good with the claimants play a substantial part. And there is nothing about Herrmann of which we feel so sure as that he will lie if he thinks lying worth-while from his own point of view.</p>
<p>[20] His story is, in brief, that he planned in accordance with instructions from Nadolny and Marguerre to commit sabotage in Kingsland, that he applied to Hinsch to furnish a man, that Hinsch said he would and brought Wozniak to him, that he learned from Wozniak, not from Hinsch that Wozniak was working in the Kingsland plant and that Wozniak thought he could accomplish something, that after one or two interviews he got distrustful of Wozniak, who seemed to him like a "nut", told Hinsch so and asked him for another man. Hinsch then brought Rodriguez to him. Herrmann then brought Wozniak and Rodriguez together and asked Wozniak if he could get Rodriguez a job</p>
<p>[21] at Kingsland. Wozniak said he could as he had a pull with the employment bureau. Still later he met the two and learned that Rodríguez had the job. He then gave them each some of the inflammatory pencils, told them how to fix them up, and instructed them to put one in a coat pocket somewhere, standing up straight. The chemicals would do the rest. He paid them not over 5540 a week — he did not seem very sure how much — during this short period. After the fire he saw Rodríguez once, but he never saw Wozniak again. He asked no questions whatever of Rodríguez, but paid him $500. gave him a fictitious address and never saw him again.</p>
<p>[22] Herrmann’s story is somewhat confirmed by the fact that probably Rodríguez was employed about the time Herrmann says, shortly before the fire, and by the fact that Wozniak has peculiarities which might lead Herrmann to characterize him as a "nut", though the word "crank" would really be more accurate. On the other hand, Herrmann before he had told this Wozniak story had seen enough of the early arguments, briefs, and affidavits in the case to know of Wozniak, to suspect him of being a bit queer, to know that the fire started at his bench, to know that Rodríguez was supposed to have usually worked next to Wozniak. But there is nothing to show that Herrmann could have learned beforehand that Rodríguez had been employed only a short time, though this is not impossible. Herrmann’s attention would before his testimony have been focussed somewhat on Rodriguez because in the early stages of the case Herrmann himself was suspected of having been the Rodriguez who worked at the plant. This suspicion was probably due to the fact that Herrmann used the name Rodriguez when he was in Mexico before going to Chile. It is argued that the fact that he used this name is a confirmation of his present story, that the name came into his head because he had employed Rodriguez. But it seems to us unlikely that Herrmann would take in Mexico the name of someone whom he had employed to set the Kingsland plant on fire, and Rodriguez is a common enough name in Spanish countries. In fact there were 20 different men named Rodriguez on the payroll at Kingsland at different times.</p>
<p>[23] Herrmann's story, as stated above, appears at its best, but there are internal difficulties in the story itself. A man named Thorne plays an important part in the theory relating to Wozniak and Rodriguez. Thorne was in the employment office of the Kingsland plant, and the theory is that he was well known to Hinsch, that Hinsch had Wozniak and Rodriguez at his command, and that Rodriguez must have obtained his employment through Thorne. There is a good deal of evidence that throws suspicion of some sort on Thorne, so far as sympathy with Germany, general lack of morals and willingness to do shady things are concerned, but nothing convincing to show Thorne’s acquaintance with Hinsch. Hinsch denies acquaintance with Thorne, but it was certainly possible that he did know him. Herrmann says he did not know Thorne, though there is some evidence that he did. Wozniak had been in the plant six months at least, and so had been there several months when Thorne was employed as an assistant in the employment office. If Hinsch had had Wozniak at his command and in the plant, there was no very good reason why Herrmann should have taken part in the scheme to have Wozniak do the work. If these other allegations are true, Herrmann would not have asked Wozniak where he was working, as he says he did the first time he saw him. He would not have asked Wozniak, as he says he did, if Wozniak could get Rodriguez a job. And Hinsch would not have assented without any discussion, as Herrmann says he did, to Herrmann’s estimate of Wozniak as unsuitable for his purpose. Herrmann’s story of his conversations with Wozniak and Rodriguez is strangely lacking in the details which would be inevitable in such conver-</p>
<p>[24] sations. if he ever employed these men for the purpose and in the way he says he did. He was pressed by German counsel for any further details of these conversations, but we get no talk as to how or where they could set the fire, or whether a fire was likely to be effective if set in Wozniak’s building, no discussion of particulars with either of them except the instructions as to the pencils which were quite explicit. This lack of detail might have been explained by the fact of which we are convinced that Wozniak’s knowledge of either English or German was extremely limited. But Herrmann says that the conversations were in English and that Wozniak spoke English freely though with an accent, a statement which in view of our judgment as to Wozniak’s ability to speak English at that time arouses further distrust.</p>
<p>[25] And the job, according to Herrmann’s story, seems to have been turned over by Herrmann to Rodríguez after he came on the scene. Rodríguez, not Wozniak, was the man relied on. Rodríguez was the only one of the two who turned up after the fire, and Herrmann explicitly says that he asked him no questions at all but paid him $5500 and never saw him again. And yet Wozniak set the fire if anyone did. And Rodríguez, the only man Herrmann saw after the fire, the only man he paid after the fire, was not at the Kingsland plant at all on the day of the fire.</p>
<p>[26] If there is one thing sure about Wozniak, it is that Wozniak was keen for money. That he would not have come after his money himself is inconceivable to us with our knowledge of Wozniak’s previous and contemporary life and habits. We have a great deal of evidence about Wozniak’s earnings and his use of his money, but we get no indication whatever that he actually got any of the money that Herrmann said he paid.</p>
<p>[27] Again, Herrmann’s description of Wozniak corresponds exactly with a poor photograph of him which, we think. Herrmann had seen before he told his story, and differs in two quite important particulars from the real Wozniak. Herrmann’s story of Wozniak’s presence later in Mexico also arouses our suspicion, partly because we are quite certain that Wozniak never was in Mexico, partly because it is improbable that, if he had turned up in Mexico, Herrmann would not have seen him. and partly because, whether Herrmann saw him or not, his talk there in Mexico with Hinsch about Wozniak’s presence in Mexico could not possibly have been so casual and inconsequential as Herrmann states that it was.</p>
<p>[28] The discrepancies and improbabilities of Herrmann’s story tend to strengthen our very strong impression from Wozniak’s acts and statements at the time of the fire and shortly thereafter and from the circumstances of the fire that Wozniak was not guilty. In the same way our impression of Wozniak, derived from careful study of these acts and statements and circumstances, tends to increase our doubt of Herrmann’s sincerity in his latest evidence.</p>
<p>[29] Our impression that Wozniak is innocent is not due to his own protestations of innocence. Any man, however guilty, might claim innocence, and Wozniak has shown in connection with matters having nothing to do with the fire that he would not let a little thing like truth stand in his way.</p>
<p>[30] Our impression is derived first from the circumstances connected with the fire itself. Gasoline was used in cleaning the shells and the fire spread quickly, so that there was great excitement and confusion. The interval between the time when the first small flame was seen and the time when everyone present ran for his life was very short. The pan of gasoline close to Wozniak’s machine (as in the case of all the 48 machines) would account for this, but in addition one workman says that one of the men threw a pail of water on the bench where the flame first appeared. (The fire buckets in the building contained water instead of sand.) Wozniak says he made an effort to stifle the fire, and</p>
<p>[31] there is evidence of another workman that he saw Wozniak make some such effort. If we were called upon to guess what caused the fire from the evidence of the circumstances, we should without hesitation turn to the machine which held the shell which Wozniak was cleaning. There is strongly persuasive evidence that these machines required constant watching, that when out of order they squeaked and threw out sparks, and that fires, quickly extinguished, had previously occurred from this source, and there is some evidence from a workman close by of squeaking and of sparks from Wozniak’s machine just at the time of the starting of the fire. Wozniak himself does not mention this in his contemporaneous statements, though he later mentioned it merely as a possible explanation. In fact he says that his machine was running well that day, though it had sometimes run very hot. To Wozniak the fire seemed to originate in the rapidly revolving shellcase itself and to follow the rag wound around a stick with which he was drying the shellcase when he withdrew the rag. It is interesting to find that his own statement is the only one which bears any resemblance to what would have happened if he had used one of the inflammatory pencils with which Herrmann says he supplied him.</p>
<p>[32] Wozniak, as we have said, is not a "nut", but a crank, He is in a way smart, though naive, and thinks he is smarter than he really is. How could such a man, or any man who had for some time been studying and planning how to set fire to the plant, start the fire at his own bench, where attention would necessarily be directed to him, to say nothing of the fact that the particular place and the particular building would not, to persons planning beforehand to set a fire, seem to be places where a fire once started would be particularly likely to be effective, as this fire certainly was? And that a smart crank like Wozniak should after starting the fire with an inflammatory pencil describe its beginning in a way which had even a slight resemblance to a pencil fire is equally incomprehensible. Also incomprehensible is the fact that a man like Wozniak should not have had ready, when he was examined a day or two later, some plausible explanation of the cause of the fire, but he certainly had no explanation at hand, though later he made various suggestions and possibilities.</p>
<p>[33] Although as we have said, Wozniak’s description of the starting of the fire bears some resemblance to what might have happened if a pencil had been used, the resemblance is not close enough to make us suspect that a pencil was actually used. But more important is the fact that Wozniak, if he used a pencil, must have abandoned completely Herrmann’s instructions as to how to use the pencils. The pencil was intended to enable an incendiary to start the fire at a time and place when and where he could not be connected with it. The pencil was devised to operate only after the lapse of from 15 to 30 minutes. It was not at all adapted to starting a fire at the place where the incendiary intended to remain. Besides, the pencil needed to stand upright, and the shell from which Wozniak said the fire seemed to start was in a horizontal position revolving in Wozniak’s machine in the process of cleaning and drying. The shells seem to have passed through the various phases of this process at the rate of about three every two minutes, an average of about 40 seconds each. Even if we assume that Wozniak had found some way — Herrmann evidently had not — to make the pencil work faster, we cannot adapt the pencil idea to the actual process, and cannot imagine that anyone planning the fire in advance would have considered it possible to use the pencil there under the eyes of the other workmen close by. Rodriguez and Wozniak are supposed to be working together on this plot. They are instructed by Herrmann and provided with pencils. They talk and plan together — supposedly — how to do the job. There are toilets available; there are workmen’s coats somewhere; there are even coats hanging about that particular room; there are</p>
<p>[34] cases of clean rags; there are dirty, gasoline-soaked rags; there must be other opportunities of which we have no evidence. And yet we are asked to believe that Wozniak started the fire with a pencil in a dry shellcase, which was revolving in his own machine at the end of this process which as a whole lasted about 40 seconds. And Rodriguez, the man really relied upon, was not there that day.</p>
<p>[35] The evidence as to Wozniak’s conduct at the moment, his examinations, his conduct during the weeks immediately succeeding, his relations with the representatives of Russia, his life before the fire and afterwards almost to the present, his disappearance, his reappearance and his subsequent testimony, his alleged appearance in Mexico among the German agents there, occupy many pages of the record and could be discussed here ad infinitum, as they have properly been discussed almost ad infinitum by counsel in their briefs and arguments. Suffice it to say that we do not believe that he was in Mexico; that the letters he wrote the Russian Embassy before the fire are in our judgment not a blind, but exactly such letters as Wozniak would compose, and indicate to us that he really, as he says, was at heart Russian, intended to go to Russia, and was shocked at the carelessness and, as he thought, corruption of the inspectors at this plant which was assembling shells for Russia; that without relying at all on his honesty of statement he nevertheless seems to us to act and talk like a man who is really innocent in respect to this fire. It is of some significance that through the Russian Consulate he sent $90 to Russia the day after the fire — not the act of a man who the previous day had destroyed this supply plant for Russian munitions, and whose money or part of it came as pay for such destruction. The picture of him which one gets from reading the reports of the four detectives who watched him night and day for about four weeks following the fire is a picture of a man frugal in the extreme, living at the Russian Immigrants’ Home, buying and cooking his own meals, milk, bread, occasionally a little fish or meat or fruit, reading Russian papers or books a good deal, quiet, with no luxuries or dissipations, almost no acquaintances, no suspicious actions, no suspicious meetings, no indication whatever that he had anything to do with his supposed co-conspirator Rodriguez or anybody connected with Germany.</p>
<p>[36] And so, despite Herrmann’s confession, the evidence in the Kingsland Case has convinced us that Wozniak did not set the Kingsland fire, and that Germany cannot be held responsible for it.</p>
<p>[37] In connection with Black Tom we shall not mention some possibilities which have practically been abandoned by the claimants, or some agents who have not been abandoned in argument, like Sauerbeck for instance. We have not ignored them but we do not think them worth talking about in connection with Black Tom.</p>
<p>[38] The picture of the fire itself, which we have in our minds as the result of our study of the voluminous, detailed, and often contradictory evidence, shows a large railroad terminal on the Black Tom promontory which stretches out from the Jersey side into New York harbor not far from Ellis Island. This terminal is full of railroad cars, many of them loaded with ammunition. At one point is a dock to which on that night were tied up a number of barges, some of which, like the cars, were loaded with shells and TNT. The yard was guarded and watched, but access to it by intentional incendiaries, particularly from the New York harbor, was certainly not impossible, perhaps not difficult. The fire started in the middle of a clear, fairly calm night at about 12:45 a.m., in the form of a small blaze which was discovered by the watchmen, breaking out around the door of a wooden boxcar which probably contained explosive shells filled with smokeless powder. There is some claim of more than one</p>
<p>[39] fire, but we do not believe there was. The fire spread, the explosions occurred, and the damage was great. It is somewhat difficult to understand how incendiaries under the circumstances as we picture them could have secured access to this car, broken into it, and set the fire without being seen or heard. Nor does it seem likely that careful planning beforehand would have resulted in setting fire at this part of the yard, or in one car, or in this particular car. There were other points of approach and other methods which in advance would have seemed more likely to produce results. But there is nothing in the circumstances which excludes incendiarism. The fact that smokeless powder, properly prepared, is conceded by experts not to be subject to spontaneous combustion is a strong argument in favor of incendiarism. But the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company in its defense to the suits brought against it for negligence relied largely upon spontaneous combustion, and we get the impression that their counsel had real faith in this particular defense. And yet they then had in their possession a good deal of the evidence which we now have which tends to implicate Kristoff.</p>
<p>[40] So far as we can see, the circumstances of the fire leave the question of its cause open. It may have been some fault in the preparation of the powder in the shells in this car; it may have come from some other cause connected with explosives, for though we know of no cause which would naturally be suggested by the supposed contents of this car we are suspicious of explosives in general; it may have come from some other accident of which no evidence appears; of course the fire may have been of incendiary origin, and in this connection it may be noted that all incendiaries are not German agents. We can be sure, however, that any German agent seeking for a chance to destroy munitions would have looked upon Black Tom with the keenest interest.</p>
<p>[41] Leaving out of account some alleged suspects who are not worth attention, there are two theories which attribute the fire to German agents. One of these theories centers about Witzke and Jahnke; the other around Kristoff. Both theories have been urged upon us strongly. The two theories may be combined into one theory, viz., that all three took part. The two theories never have been, in fact, so definitely separated in the arguments or in the evidence as our statement above would imply. But we insist upon the separation. We are sure that if Witzke and Jahnke were concerned in Black Tom no person like Kristoff would have been needed or used. He would have been not only a superfluity but a nuisance, even a menace. Witzke and Jahnke strike us as capable, capable where German interests were involved of desperate measures not in the least in need of assistance from an individual like Kristoff. We do not believe that they would even have trusted Kristoff to row a boat, much less to take a real part in any Black Tom expedition.</p>
<p>[42] Witzke took part in an expedition from Mexico into Arizona after the United States entered the war. He was betrayed by his companion, Altendorf. who was in the employ of the United States as well of the Germans, convicted as a spy by court-martial, sentenced to death. He was a spy and the sentence was appropriate, but it was later commuted to life imprisonment and still later he was released. The evidence of participation in Black Tom by Witzke and Jahnke consists chiefly of admissions alleged to have been made by Witzke to his companion Altendorf before he was captured, with some confirmation by another companion, Gleaves, and by others including one or two guards who talked to him during his confinement. The alleged admissions cover not only Black Tom but also Kingsland. Witzke has consistently denied these admissions during his trial and confinement and since his release. As we have so definite an impression about Kingsland, the inclusion of Kingsland in his supposed admissions would of itself make it almost impossible for us to accept the admis-</p>
<p>[43] sion so far as concerns Black Tom. Altendorf, the chief witness as to admissions by Witzke, is also the chief liar who has appeared in the cases before us, a chief among competitors of no mean qualifications. The details, so far as any details appear in the supposed admissions, have little relation to probability, even if we assume that Witzke and Jahnke were actually involved in Black Tom. It is perhaps unnecessary to add anything to the above, but we are also satisfied from the evidence that Witzke and Jahnke were not in the east at the time of the Black Tom fire.</p>
<p>[44] The only effect which all the evidence and argument with respect to Witzke and Jahnke has had upon us is to add considerably to the doubts which we would in any event have had with respect to the evidence implicating Kristoff. Kristoff never set the Black Tom fire alone. Witzke and Jahnke being eliminated, there are no persons in the evidence who seem at all likely to have been his companions, a fact which is nowhere near conclusive but which adds to our doubts. And the actual evidence against Kristoff is so nearly of the same nature as these categorical admissions attributed to Witzke that when we find ourselves satisfied that Witzke’s alleged admissions mean nothing to us our doubts as to analogous admissions and other analogous testimony are strengthened.</p>
<p>[45] Suspicion was focussed very early on Kristoff in connection with Black Tom. He lived at the time at Bayonne, N. J, with an aunt, Mrs. Rushnak, whose daughter was Mrs. Chapman at whose house Kristoff had sometimes roomed earlier. A day or two after Black Tom Mrs. Chapman reported to Lieutenant Rigney, a police officer of Bayonne whom she knew well, that Kristoff had reached home on the night of the fire at about four o’clock in the morning, that he was greatly excited, and that her mother heard him walking in his room and heard him say "What I do! What I do!" and that they suspected him of being responsible for the Black Tom fire. We feel sure that this is all they reported. Both Rigney and Charlock, a detective who was assigned to the case and followed it assiduously, say so, and we take pleasure in adding that we believe them. We also believe what Mrs. Chapman then reported to Rigney, and we believe that the two women really suspected Kristoff. Later Mrs. Chapman said that she at some earlier time saw something like a blueprint or blueprints in Kristoff’s room, when he was in her house, and that in his absence she once read a letter, which he had written but had not yet sent, to a man named Grandson or Grandor, demanding a large sum of money. We do not believe that Kristoff had a blueprint, certainly not for his own use, for we do not believe that he could use one. His own story about Graentsor makes it possible that he wrote a letter such as Mrs. Chapman described, but we doubt any story told by her after Kristoff’s own story to the police came to her knowledge. The value of any evidence by Mrs. Rushnak and Mrs. Chapman, except as to Kristoff’s late arrival, his excitement, and the "What I do!", will appear from their later statements. Mrs. Chapman said later that Kristoff was in the habit of going away on trips and that wherever he went there was always an explosion, and they both said later, some ten years or more later, that Kristoff told Mrs. Rushnak the morning after the fire that he had set the fire. We feel quite sure that they really suspected Kristoff in spite of the fact that Mrs. Chapman’s husband later told Green in Charlock’s presence that his wife had reported the matter to Rigney merely because she was in a family way and thought she might get some money from the Lehigh Valley Railroad. As to the reasonableness of their then suspicion, we can judge only by our own guess from the late arrival, the excitement, and the "What I do". Mrs. Chapman’s and Mrs. Rushnak’s judgments on a given state of facts are worthless. At this stage of the evidence we can only add that Kristoff was a man who</p>
<p>[46] probably returned late at night at other times, that excitement whether for a good reason or for a trivial reason was probably not an unusual event for Kristoff, and that if he was excited it is unlikely that he expressed his excitement in the English language. The "What I do! What I do!" is probably Mrs. Rushnak's translation of what she heard Kristoff say. But at the same time it is hardly likely that it is not a substantially correct translation.</p>
<p>[47] The name Grantnor is of great significance in this case. The connection between Kristoff and Hinsch, who was a German agent and who is alleged to have used Kristoff as his tool in Black Tom, depends substantially on whether Hinsch used the name Grantnor as an alias. One Frank Oscar Granson seems to have been actually an individual who later was a witness in the Rintelen case, whom Hinsch is supposed to have known. The theory pressed upon us is that Hinsch in seeking aliases was accustomed to adopt names familiar to him and so adopted Granson. Why he should have changed it to Grantnor, or Graentnor, as it is more commonly spelled in the evidence, and why he should have changed Frank to Francis, is not explained. The actual spelling is of importance, for Grantnor is an English name and Graentnor is not, and Grantnor and Graentnor are pronounced differently. The significance of the spelling applies particularly to Herrmann’s evidence, for Herrmann was obviously in doubt as to the spelling. Herrmann to corroborate his testimony that Hinsch used the name Grantnor says that he laughed at Hinsch for using the name because it was an English name and Hinsch, as was obvious to anyone, was a German. There is no sense in this testimony of Herrmann if the name was spelled Graentnor or if Herrmann thought it might have been so spelled. Herrmann, though born in the United States, was a thorough German — knew the German language thoroughly. He could not have called Graentnor an English name, and he could not have imagined that a name, which he had heard often pronounced and was accustomed himself to pronounce Grantnor. might possibly be spelled Graentnor.</p>
<p>[48] The name, whatever it is, appeared first in Kristoff’s story to the police on his arrest in 1916. We have a verbatim report of one of these examinations. As Kristoff first used the name here, it is spelled Graentsor. In the other places in this report it appears as Graentor and many times. How it was then pronounced we do not know. In the police examination of Kristoff later in 1921, the name appears as Gramshaw, indicating that Kristoff when using the name himself always insisted on the "s". Kristoff does not seem to have raised any question in his first police examination as to the dropping of the "s" by his examiners, or as to the pronunciation, whatever it may have been. But Kristoff was not the kind of man to worry about such changes so long as he understood what man they were asking him about. And Kristoff was not the kind of man to invent the name, whatever the name was. He must have known some man who called himself either Grantsor, Grantnor, Graentnor. Grandor, or perhaps Gramshaw.</p>
<p>[49] Rigney and Charlock were of the Bayonne police force. As Black Tom was in the jurisdiction of the Jersey City police, Rigney reported Mrs. Chapman’s story to them. At their request Rigney arrested Kristoff about 30 days after the fire and turned him over to the Jersey City police. The case was in charge of one Green, now dead, but Charlock kept in close touch with it. Kristoff was committed as a suspicious person on a disorderly-conduct charge, held for about 25 days, and then discharged. During this time the police became convinced that he ought to be examined for insanity, and he was so examined by Dr. King of the prison where he was confined. King, who seems to have had substantial experience in this line, reported that his intelligence was of low order, that his talk was rambling and he could not keep his mind on any given</p>
<p>[50] line, but that he was not in his opinion dangerous. King made up his mind that Kristoff had nothing to do with Black Tom. Rigney and Charlock came definitely to the same conclusion. We do not know what Green thought, but the fact that Kristoff was discharged makes it certain that at the least the Jersey City police had not sufficient evidence to make the charge against him, and it is significant also that they did not keep Kristoff under surveillance or do anything else towards pushing the matter further. Their judgment is important, for they certainly had a good deal of the evidence now so strongly relied upon.</p>
<p>[51] One of the main points now relied upon is the breaking-down of Kristoff’s alibi. But that alibi broke down at once. Kristoff on being questioned by the police said he was at the time of the fire at the house of his aunt at Yonkers. Green apparently went to his aunt’s house and was told he had not been there that night. It does not definitely appear that Green made further investigation on this point.</p>
<p>[52] But we can have no doubt that the police, before letting go of Kristoff, not only cross-examined him thoroughly about this broken-down alibi but that they catechized Kristoff time and again about this and everything else suspicious or doubtful in his statements or his actions so far as they could learn of them; his returning late, why he was excited, why he said "What I do! What I do!", his Graentsor story — everything they could possibly think of. Rigney said he did his best before turning him over to the Jersey City police. Charlock said he examined him many times, the last time when he was discharged. Green and others of the Jersey police must have done the same thing. Green particularly could not have dropped the alibi after he had broken it down, or dropped Kristoff until he had tried to get some explanation. They must have got everything they could. We do not know whether Green was satisfied of Kristoff’s innocence, but Rigney and Charlock were. We cannot help giving weight to the fact that they discharged Kristoff when it would have been the great glory of any of these men to find and convict the culprit in this great disaster. And we might even suggest that the gentlemen of the press doubtless knew everything that the police knew, that many people who knew Kristoff knew that he was arrested and why, that reporters were questioning and hunting, and that any well-intentioned person who knew anything suspicious about Kristoff would have been likely to bring it to the attention of reporters or police authorities. The Black Tom disaster and Kristoff were certainly in the limelight.</p>
<p>[53] The most extraordinary part of Kristoff’s story to the police was with respect to the man with the kaleidoscopic name, whom we will for convenience call Grantnor. According to Kristoff, Grantnor met him in the Pennsylvania Station in New York, asked him the time, got to talking, and then and there employed him to take with him a long trip, covering many cities, including cities as far west as Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis, staying from one to three days in these various places. He lent Grantnor $275, for which Grantnor was to pay him $5,000. He received from Grantnor only a few cents at a time, but at St. Louis Grantnor gave him a dollar to go to the theatre, and when Kristoff came back Grantnor was gone and Kristoff never saw him again except once when he met him by chance on the street in New York, when Grantnor agreed to get him a job and being in a hurry made an appointment for that night at the McAlpin Hotel, where, strangely enough, he was not to be found when Kristoff went there to get the job. Kristoff knew nothing whatever about what Grantnor did on these trips, except that Grantnor told him he was trying to get contracts. Grantnor had two suitcases which Kristoff said contained plans and blueprints. Kristoff’s sole duties were to carry the suitcases and to watch them when Grantnor was not in his room. Kristoff</p>
<p>[54] did not go out with Grantnor in any of these cities, except for a casual ride or two, and did not see any of the people with whom Grantnor talked. He had asked Grantnor for his regular address but never got it. When first employed he was supposed to be paid $20 per week, but he never got even that.</p>
<p>[55] The story is suspicious enough in all conscience. If Grantnor can be shown to be Hinsch, we can easily get a good deal of truth out of the story and add a good deal of detail. Hinsch himself testifies that he never went further west than Gettysburg.</p>
<p>[56] But the first thing the story shows us is Kristoff himself. There is no danger that the story represents real facts, but it does represent Kristoff. Whether Kristoff was trying to tell the truth and couldn’t, or whether he was trying to make up a good-looking lie and couldn’t, we get a vivid picture of a simpleton, almost a plain fool, and we know that King is complimenting him when he speaks of him as a man of a low order of intellect.</p>
<p>[57] That is in substance all the direct testimony we have at that time from Kristoff himself. The police had it and did their best with it. Charlock was particularly interested in Grantnor and asked Kristoff to try to find him and let Charlock know. Kristoff is now dead.</p>
<p>[58] In the course of the later investigations of Kristoff we have alleged admissions by him, which are seriously important testimony, whatever doubts we may have regarding them.</p>
<p>[59] These admissions are reported by a detective named Kassman, one of the men of the Burns Detective Agency, which was employed by the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company to shadow Kristoff. From October or November, 1916, to April, 1917, Kassman devoted himself to Kristoff, working in the same factory, getting intimate with him, eating with him, convincing Kristoff that Kassman was an anarchist and so acquiring his confidence, talking to Kristoff about the Black Tom fire and about the possibility of damaging other munition plants, which Kassman professed to Kristoff to be very anxious to do. The evidence shows that Kassman, whether a compatriot or not, could speak some language which Kristoff spoke naturally, and spoke little English himself. We judge therefore that their talk was not in English and that Kassman’s reports which in the evidence are in English must be translations of what Kassman reported in the language which he used in talking with Kristoff.</p>
<p>[60] We have not all of Kassman’s reports. Why we do not know. We get the impression that the reports we have, which run along from the beginning of his employment to the end with varying intervals between the reports, were selected and put together in the shape submitted to us; not selected for the purpose of submission to us but for some other purpose. Very likely they were so selected because they seemed to the person making the selection to be the only important reports in a long series. Whatever the explanation, the reports as submitted to us omit much that seems important to us. We cannot accept at face value admissions appearing in reports from a detective when other reports from the same detective are lacking, which may conceivably contain denials, or explanations or sidelights, or statements of fact which are inconsistent with other circumstances which we know or with the alleged admissions.</p>
<p>[61] And Kassman, entirely unconsciously, discredits every admission by Kristoff which appears in his reports. In his affidavit to the Commission stating that the attached are some of his reports and that they are true, Kassman undertakes to state, again in English, what Kristoff admitted to him, and this statement not only changes the language of the admissions in the reports but also changes the substance very materially. Where Kristoff in the alleged admissions speaks of "steamboats" at Black Tom upon which he and his companions set fires, Kassman in his affidavit speaks of "barges", There were no "steamboats"</p>
<p>[62] at Black Tom, but there were "barges". Again, the admissions in the reports speak only of setting fires on "steamboats", and we see no reason to believe that any fires were set on any boats, whether steamboats or barges. Kassman in his affidavit says that Kristoff said not only that a fire was set on a barge, but also that one man set a fire among the cars. The affidavit is made about 10 years later than the reports, but the difference is not forgetfulness. It is the conscious effort of Kassman to say what the immediate necessity seems to him to call for. If the admissions do not fit, he is prepared to make them fit and does his best.</p>
<p>[63] Kassman’s reports were in the hands of the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company when the cases against the company, arising out of Black Tom, were tried. So far as we can ascertain, the evidence was not used. We can see reasons for this from the point of view of successful defense, and we are not inclined to attach great weight to this point or to the fact that they urged spontaneous combustion so persistently. The only weight we would give to the last point arises from the impression of sincerity which the language used by the railroad’s counsel makes on us. It is somewhat singular that it makes this impression, for we are all used to pleadings and openings and arguments, and in most cases would not get any impression one way or the other from them. But of course there is no estoppel here, and the opinions of counsel in other cases, however sincere, do not establish facts for the cases before us.</p>
<p>[64] Nor were these reports made the basis for any criminal action against Kristoff. This would be of some importance if they had been in the possession of the police, but we can understand that the railroad company or the present claimants would not be particularly interested in punishing Kristoff but might be hoping to supplement whatever evidence Kassman supplied so as to reach whatever influences were behind him.</p>
<p>[65] The language of the confessions is not in itself persuasive of their truth. They sound as do the admissions alleged to have been made in Mexico, more like a reproduction of gossip current in the circles of the man who used the language — whether that man was really Kristoff or whether the language comes from Kassman only and not from Kristoff— than they do like statements of fact made by or quoted from a man who is telling what he himself did. More important still, they do not correspond to the facts and circumstances of the fire. Nor do we like the fact that the language of the admissions is always substantially exactly the same and is very brief, whether it is quoted from Kristoff or (in one instance) from Grossman, who is alleged, after having emphatically told Kristoff in Kassman’s presence that he must never under any circumstances say anything about Black Tom, to have told Kassman at a later interview alone just what Kristoff told Kassman and in the same brief, crisp language. We are more than suspicious, we disbelieve, in fact, when Kristofi is alleged to have introduced Kassman to Grossman’s favor by telling him that Kassman is an anarchist. Grossman is not an anarchist. The evidence convinces us that he is a respectable citizen. He has been a member of the Republican County Committee in his county for 15 years. Rigney tells us that his lather-in-law lived in Grossman’s house with him about 10 years and always spoke in the highest terms of him. Grossman is a cautious man. And he is easily scared. We attribute much of the confusion and contradiction in his testimony partly to the fact that he was scared — not because of conscious complicity with a criminal, but by the nature of the occasion — and partly to the fact that he is deaf. We get no unfavorable impression from Grossman’s testimony, and we are particularly impressed by the fact that he refused to testify until assured that some representative of the United States Government would be present.</p>
<p>[66] But to return to Kassman. The admission in each case is that Kristoff worked with some German group. Kristoff never naturally used such an expression as "German group". This is Kassman’s language; he was employed, as he says, to find Kristoff’s connection with some German group, and this is language which he puts in Kristoff’s mouth, though of course it may be a substantially accurate transposition of something Kristoff said. Kassman pressed Kristoff for names, and says that Kristoff said he would tell him later, but Kristoff never did.</p>
<p>[67] The omissions in the reports are very remarkable. In substance the reports are composed of anarchists, lunches, and suppers, and brief categorical statements about Kassman’s desire to destroy, Kristoff’s unwillingness to join Kassman in sabotage because of police, and Kristoff’s admissions about Black Tom.</p>
<p>[68] One singular omission is that Kristoff does not congregate with other German agents. The urge to congregate is in all the other testimony the most marked characteristic of all German agents. But we hear nothing of Kristoff’s meeting other German agents or even sympathizers. No name appears even of all the various Germans mentioned in our other testimony. And the admissions are brief and rare episodes in a long series of uneventful, common-place stuff. We even doubt whether "anarchists" as used by Kassman really means "anarchists" in any accurate sense.</p>
<p>[69] Another doubt — the most important perhaps — arises from the absence of conversations about Mrs. Rushnak, Mrs. Chapman, about Kristoff’s supposed travels in the west, about Grantnor, about Kristoff’s alibi, etc. We can feel sure that Kassman was not put on this job without being supplied with all the information the people who employed him already had. His natural approach towards getting information from Kristoff would not be this anarchistic talk and the ridiculously crude, unskillful talk — from the point of view of a man supposed to be a detective — about munitions and about Black Tom itself. He would naturally begin on Kristoff with talk about the west, the cities where Kristoff told the police he had been to see if Kristoff really knew about the cities and said anything about the trip, whom he was with, what he did. After Kristoff began talking about his arrest by the police, Kassman would have a perfect opening for talking over the whole story, the trip, Grantnor, whom Kristoff and Grantnor saw on the trip, Mrs. Rushnak, Mrs. Chapman, the alibi, what he really did the night of the fire, whether he was excited when he got home and why, and the "What I do". It is inconceivable that Kassman did not go into all these subjects with Kristoff in the course of the six months he followed him up. Either Kassman was a fool, or he had those talks and made reports about them which we have not got. If he got so intimate with Kristoff as to get confessions about Black Tom, he would have found no difficulty in getting Kristoff to talk over his whole story to the police. Kristoff would have been rather proud that he got away from the police, would have enjoyed his cleverness in producing a story from which they could make nothing, would have talked freely about Rigney, King, Charlock, and Green, who had examined him and tried to get him to confess. We hear nothing about any of these things.</p>
<p>[70] Kristoff’s experience with detectives was not at an end, even when Kassman was taken off his track. In 1921 he was arrested in Albany and while in jail there another detective was placed with him in the guise of a prisoner and attempted to gain his confidence and secure admissions. Nothing came of this. At the same time he was examined with great thoroughness by counsel for the Lehigh Valley and by others. Kristoff seems to have professed willingness to help them in every way, probably with the idea of thereby securing his</p>
<p>[71] release from jail, but we get nothing whatever except that he was ready, he could be taken to Philadelphia, to point out a house which he thought was used as a rendezvous by German agents. The court granted an order for his removal from jail under guard to visit Philadelphia, but we do not even learn that they took him there. They did at least take him to New York where he was confronted with Mrs. Rushnak and Mrs. Chapman, and a strenuous effort was made by all concerned to get him to admit Black Tom. He denied all connection with Black Tom. It also appears in close connection with this story that Mrs. Rushnak was in 1918 under surveillance of a woman detective in the guise of a lodger in her house. This was evidently done for the purpose of securing evidence from Mrs. Rushnak that Kristoff came home late the night of the fire. It seems singular that this should have been necessary, but doubtless Mrs. Rushnak had in the interval between 1916 and 1918 denied this story. The woman detective did report that Mrs. Rushnak finally admitted to her that Kristoff came home late, but she insisted at the same time that Kristoff not infrequently came home late, and that he was absolutely innocent, and added that she had merely made it easier for him to secure his release from the police in 1916 by denying that he came home late.</p>
<p>[72] Apart from Kristoff’s supposed statement that he worked in some unidentified German group, we have no connection of Kristoff with Germans except his possible connection with Hinsch. His group statement certainly is not enough for us. We have to be convinced that Hinsch was Grantnor or Grantsor or Graentnor in order to get a good start on the idea that Hinsch through Kristoff was responsible for Black Tom. His Grantsor story must be connected up with Hinsch. In his own evidence there is no such connection except his meeting Grantnor later in New York when Grantnor told Kristoff he could find him at the McAlpin Hotel. This is where German agents sometimes roomed, and it is argued that this statement connected him with Hinsch. But it seems hardly likely that Hinsch would have mentioned the McAlpin if he was trying to get rid of Kristoff. He would have given him some fictitious address or some address which had no relation to Germans.</p>
<p>[73] The only evidence worth considering that Hinsch was Grantnor is the evidence that Hinsch called himself Grantnor. This comes from Herrmann and Hadler. It seems possible, but we regard the evidence of Herrmann as wholly unreliable.</p>
<p>[74] When Herrmann appeared before the American and German Agents at Washington he told the Agents that he could not remember any Grantsor or Gransor. This was on his arrival from Chile after he had decided to testify in behalf of the claimants, but before his formal examination. He was then asked to write out his own story which he did that night, and in this story he speaks of Hinsch calling himself Grantnor, and corroborates it by relating that as a joke Hinsch called him Rodriguez just after the Kingsland fire, and that he retorted by calling Hinsch Grantnor. In his cross-examination about his complete failure to remember Grantnor or Grantsor at first, it seems plainly apparent that he had been reminded of Grantnor in conversation after his failure to remember, and also that the question of Grantnor had been the subject of discussion on his journey from Chile. Grantnor, as we have said, is the missing link in this part of the story, and this failure of Herrmann to remember the name at all is a stumbling block to believing what he later says on this point.</p>
<p>[75] Herrmann also was very doubtful about the spelling of the name. He tries twice to spell it and each time gives alternatives, Grantnor and Graentnor, though no German could think that the name, if pronounced in English fashion, could possibly be spelled Graentnor.</p>
<p>[76] Herrmann also says he had heard Hilken call Hinsch Grantnor but Hilken. one thing to his credit, does not even testify that Hinsch used the name Grantnor. and Hilken knew Hinsch better than anyone else. Hilken even testifies that he never heard of Grantnor.</p>
<p>[77] Hadler’s testimony as a whole is unconvincing. If he had told only about Hinsch’s claims in Mexico to credit for Black Tom and Kingsland we would be more inclined to believe him. But his identification of Wozniak is nonsense in itself, and particularly so as we think that Wozniak never was in Mexico. And we take no stock in his story of the frequent repetition of the Rodriguez-Grantnor joke. It would not have been a joke at all in Mexico for there seems to be no doubt that Herrmann called himself Rodriguez there. But the most convincing point about this evidence by Hadler is that this joke, if it ever happened, was first made in the United States immediately after the Kingsland fire. We do not believe that both Herrmann and Hinsch were so lacking in humor that they continued to work this joke after they got to Mexico, and in the presence of such a person as Hadler. It is the kind of joke that they would keep for their own amusement, even if one can imagine that it continued to amuse them. Hadler carried this joke too far.</p>
<p>[78] One is rather inclined to regard Hinsch’s story that he gave up sabotage when he took over the Deutschland work as quite likely to be true. He may not have done this at once, but it seems more than likely that he would not while the Deutschland was at Baltimore have been active in sabotage. We do not regard the question whether Hinsch was absent from Baltimore during the two days before Black Tom as important in itself. He did not need to be absent, if they had been planning Black Tom for some time. Its importance relates only to Hinsch’s credibility, and it does not have much importance from this point of view. It has some bearing on the credibility of other witnesses also. Our impression is that Hinsch was not absent from Baltimore at this time.</p>
<p>[79] The fact that Hinsch let Herrmann stay around Baltimore, and that Herrmann probably did some things or talked of some things in connection with sabotage at this time, and the talk about the pencils which Herrmann seems to have had with him at this time, tends against Hinsch’s claim that he cut loose from sabotage. We would guess that Herrmann was not really doing much but talk and plan, and that Herrmann himself, particularly when the Deutschland was there, was doing nothing but work about her. And it is of course conceivable that we are wrong in disbelieving Marguerre’s evidence that Herrmann was to take no action against munition plants or American property unless the United States entered the war. We do not believe that Hinsch would have mixed up sabotage so closely with the Deutschland, either by taking part in it himself or by letting Herrmann work on the Deutschland if Herrmann was then active in sabotage.</p>
<p>[80] In certain cases an accumulation of items, each in itself too doubtful to be relied upon but all leading in the same direction, results in reasonable certainty. The evidence of fact in this case has pointed in a number of different directions, but even when some special part of the evidence has pointed in some one direction it has failed to carry conviction. The Kristoff evidence with which we have dealt comes the nearest to leading somewhere.</p>
<p>[81] We cannot be sure that Kristoff did not set fire to Black Tom or take some part in so doing. We cannot be sure that Graentsor, or Grantnor, or Graentnor was not Hinsch, and that Hinsch did not employ Kristoff and others who are unknown. But it will sufficiently appear from the foregoing that, as we have said, the evidence falls far short of enabling us to reach the point, not merely</p>
<p>[82] of holding Germany responsible for the fire, but of thinking that her agents must have been the cause, even though the proof is lacking.</p>

Decision on Petitions for Rehearing Petitions for a rehearing have been filed by the American Agent in the so-called Black Tom Case on January 12, 1931, and in the so-called Kingsland Case on January 22, 1931. No new evidence is filed with these petitions. Although the rules of this Commission, conforming to the practice of inter- national commissions, make no provision for a rehearing in any case in which a final decree has been entered, these petitions have been carefully considered by the Commission. The briefs previously filed in behalf of the United States and the detailed argument of its Agent at The Hague in September, 1930, were marked by ability and thoroughness to which was added the force of his sincere conviction. It is therefore not surprising that the present petitions for rehearing bring out no new argument. We have studied them carefully to see if we have misin- terpreted or misunderstood anything or failed to consider or to give due weight to any of the considerations now urged as a basis for rehearing. We are satisfied that we had a clear understanding of the Agent's position with respect to every point now presented and that every one of these facts or arguments was given careful consideration by us. The terms of the Treaty of Berlin determine the financial obligations of Germany so far as this Commission is concerned. Both Governments and the Commission from the outset have recognized that in order to hold Germany liable for damages incurred during the period of neutrality this Treaty requires affirmative proof that such damages were the result of an act of the Imperial German Government or of its agents. The previous decisions of the Commission invariably have been based on this requirement. In the instant cases our conclusions were that the evidence did not convince us that the damages were the result of such acts. The substance of the petitions is that our conclusions were wrong. They may be, as we make no claim to infallibility, but they were and are our conclusions and nothing in the present petitions impairs our confidence in their correctness. We think it futile to criticize the Agent's criticisms of our judgment, even of our good faith. One of his criticisms, however, which involves a jurisdictional question, calls for comment. This question is raised by the American Agent's claim that the decision was irregularly rendered because the Umpire participated in the deliberations of the National Commissioners and in the opinion of the Commission. The Umpire participated in the deliberations of the Commissioners and in the opinion in accordance with the usual practice of the Commission in cases of importance since its foundation in 1922, a practice never before questioned and not in our judgment of doubtful validity even if it had not so long been accepted by all concerned. These petitions for rehearing are dismissed.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>103 A new jurisdictional question is raised in these petitions by the requests that subpoenas be issued by the Commission for the purpose of taking the oral testimony of certain witnesses. This suggestion is contrary to the unbroken practice of the Commission. The Agreement of August 10, 1922, between Germany and the United States, which established this Commission and is the foundation of its jurisdiction, does not authorize it to issue subpoenas for witnesses or to administer oaths and take the oral testimony of witnesses. The requests that subpoenas be now issued by the Commission for the purpose of taking oral testimony are based upon an Act of Congress approved July 3, 1930, having general application to international commissions, which the American Agent contends applies to this Commission and authorizes it to take this procedure. The Commission is of the opinion that the jurisdiction con- ferred upon it by the two Governments in their Agreement of August 10, 1922, cannot be extended by this later statute of the United States. Even if it had authority, the Commission would not change its practice at this stage of these cases, when the evidence has been formally closed, the arguments made, and the decisions rendered. Accordingly, the requests in these petitions that the Commission issue sub- poenas for the oral examination of witnesses are also denied. In these petitions the American Agent states that he is collecting new evidence the submission of which will be the subject of supplementary petitions. Apart from the objection above noted to the taking of oral testimony, the Commission has pointed out in its decision denying the petition for rehearing filed by the American Agent in the Philadelphia-Girard National Bank case a number of objections to the submission of new evidence by either party as a basis for reopening or reconsidering decisions rendered in cases finally submitted. Some of these objections involve serious jurisdictional questions. The questions to be presented in the proposed supplementary petitions, however, are not dealt with by the Commission in this order, which deals only with the present petitions for rehearing on the basis of the evidence filed at the time these cases were submitted for decision. Each of the two Governments has expressed a desire that the Commission wind up its labors as soon as practicable. All but a very few of the cases having been decided and there being only a comparatively small amount of work remaining to be done, it is necessary to set a final date by which each Agent should tender any further matter he may intend to ask the Commission to consider. That date is fixed as May 1, 1931. Done at Washington March 30. 1931.</p>

<p>IN GENERAL; DIARY, CHECKBOOKS. —JURISDICTION: REHEARING. Request filed July 1, 1931, for rehearing after final judgment of October 16, 1930. Analysis of new evidence (see supra). Held that expert evidence is often and at best only an aid to judgment, but far from an infallible guide. Unneces- sary, in view of negative result of analysis, to decide on Commission's jurisdiction te reopen claim, despite opposition from national Commissioner, once it has been formally passed upon and decided. (Decision subsequently set aside: see decision of June 3, 1936, p. 222 infra.) Cross-reference: A.J.I.L., Vol. 27 (1933), pp. 345-364. Bibliography: Witenberg, Vol. Ill, pp. 12-16; Woolsey, A.J.I.L.. Vol. 33 (1939). p. 739, and Vol. 34 (1940), p. 29; Annual Digest, 1931-32, p. 425. Certificate of Disagreement by the two National Commissioners on Supplemental Petition foi Rehearing A supplemental petition for a rehearing, based on newly-submitted evidence, was filed on July 1, 1931, by the American Agent in the so-called Black Tom and Kingsland cases, asking the Commission to reopen and reconsider its decision of October 16, 1930, dismissing those claims. This supplemental petition was preceded by petitions for a rehearing filed respectively on January 12 and January 22, 1931, which were based on the grounds that the Commission, in rendering its original decision, " committed manifest errors in its findings of fact on the evidence submitted and in failing to apply important established principles of law and the rules of the Commis- sion ", and also made the point " that the decision was irregularly rendered because the Umpire participated in the deliberations of the national Commis- sioners and in the opinion of the Commission ". On March 30, 1931, the Commission, in its decision on the questions raised by those petitions, overruled the objections to the participation by the Umpire in the deliberations and decision of the Commission, and dismissed, for reasons stated, the petitions in so far as they were based on the evidence contained in the record at the time the cases were submitted at the conclusion of the oral argument at The Hague. The Commission reserved, however, for later decision the question of reopening and reconsidering its original decision on new evidence which the American Agent had already announced he intended to submit by supplemental petition. The question thus reserved is now presented by the pending supplemental petition, on which the present proceedings come before the Commission. In these circumstances the only questions now to be dealt with are those raised by the submission of new evidence, and the Commission, accordingly, will</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>105 not re-examine the findings of fact made in its original decision of October 16, 1930, unless the Commission decides that it has jurisdiction to reopen these cases and the new evidence now submitted requires reversal or modification of such findings of fact. The Commission has already heard, at its session held in Boston on July 30—August 1, 1931, oral argument by both Agents on some of the issues involved. No decision was rendered at that time because the German Agent was authorized to submit some additional information in regard to his conten- tion that certain documentary evidence presented by the American Agent was not authentic. In consequence much additional evidence has been submitted on both sides since the Boston meeting. For a considerable time during that period the Commission was without an Umpire, but on April 8, 1932, when the Commission was again fully organized, it held a meeting in Washington and entered an order fixing definite time limits for the submission of any further evidence by either Agent. This order was amended, in agreement with both Agents, at a meeting held in Washington on November 1, 1932, and, as amen- ded, required that the submission of evidence on both sides be finally closed on November 15, 1932, and fixed November 21, 1932, and succeeding days for oral argument on both sides, and the final submission of these cases at the close of such argument. In order to make the record complete, mention must be made of a motion presented by the American Agent on February 5, 1932, for the production by subpoena of the Commission of certain witnesses for oral examination. The Commission had already dismissed, in its decision of March 30, 1931, a similar motion by the American Agent, on the ground of lack of authority to subpoena witnesses without the consent of both Governments. The new motion, renewing this request, was opposed by the German Agent on behalf of his Government and, accordingly, the matter was referred, at the suggestion of the Commission, to the two Governments for direct action between themselves if they wished to confer the proposed authority on the Commission. Such authority has not been conferred by the two Governments, and accordingly, this new motion has not been and cannot be considered by the Commission. The foregoing brief review of the proceedings hitherto taken since the decision of October 16, 1930, brings the history of these cases down to the recent session which closed on November 25, 1932, when all the pending questions presented by this supplemental petition and the accompanying evidence were finally submitted. A preliminary objection to the reconsideration by the Commission of its original decision has been raised by the German Agent on the jurisdictional ground that the Commission is without authority to admit the further evidence now offered for consideration by the Agent of the United States, or to grant a rehearing on the basis of such evidence, or any other evidence, after these claims had been dismissed by the Commission in its decision of October 16, 1930. The Commission has taken note of this objection, but did not feel called upon to make a ruling on its validity at the outset. In all similar cases, including the proceedings on the original petitions for rehearing in these cases filed in January, 1931, the Commission has invariably taken the position that, as stated in its decision of March 30, 1931, " although the rules of this Com- mission, conforming to the practice of international commissions, make no provision for a rehearing in any case in which a final decree has been entered, these petitions have been carefully considered by the Commission ". The Commission has, accordingly, followed in the present proceedings the precedent thus established.</p>

<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>Coming now to the issues raised by the newly-submitted evidence, it must be noted, before discussing this evidence, that, as stated in the Commission's decision on the former petitions for rehearing. " The terms of the Treaty of Berlin determine the financial obligations of Germany so far as this Commission is concerned. Both Governments and the Commission from the outset have recognized that in order to hold Germany liable for damages incurred during the period of neutrality this Treaty requires affirmative proof that such damages were the result of an act of the Imperial German Government or of its agents. The previous decisions of the Commission invariably have been based on this requirement. In the instant cases our conclusions were that the evidence did not convince us that the damages were the result of such acts." It must also be noted that the Commission in its original decision of October 16, 1930, stated that " The Commission does not need direct proof but on the evidence as submitted we could hold Germany responsible if, but only if, we are reasonably convinced that the fires occurred in some way through the acts of certain German agents." In that decision the Commission also stated that in view of the background established in these cases, which showed authorized sabotage activities in the United States by a group of German agents, " in- ferences against Germany were rendered easier than they otherwise would be", which means, in application to the present proceedings, that if the two men who are now presented by the claimants as responsible for the Kingsland and Black Tom fires respectively, namely, Theodore Wozniak and Michael Kris toff, are shown to have been German agents, or employed by German agents, at the time of those fires, the Commission might feel justified in inferring, unless such inferences were prohibited by other evidence, that Germany was responsible under the Treaty of Berlin for those fires and liable for the resulting damages. The new evidence now submitted by the American Agent is intended to establish such agency on the part of Wozniak and Kristoff. As to the Kingsland case, the Commission in its original decision found as a fact that " despite Herrmann's confession the evidence in the Kingsland case has convinced us that Wozniak did not set the Kingsland fire ", and the Com- mission held as its final conclusion, from all the evidence, " that the fire was not caused by any German agent " and, accordingly, that " Germany cannot be held responsible for it ". In reaching its conclusion the Commission found, among other facts, that another employee of the Agency of Canadian Car and Foundry Company, Limited, named Rodriguez, who also was alleged to be a German agent acting in cooperation with Wozniak in starting the fire, and to whom it was alleged that $500 was paid as compensation by Herrmann after the fire, " was not at the Kingsland plant at all on the day of the fire ". The Commission also found that the description of the starting of the fire, as presented in the evidence, did not justify the belief that it was started by one of the incendiary pencils alleged to have been furnished to Wozniak and Rodriguez for that purpose, and, further, the Commission disbelieved that Wozniak was in Mexico after the fire, where the evidence submitted by the claimants represented that he had gone and consorted with admitted German agents. As to the Black Tom case, the Commission was unable to find definitely, from the evidence filed prior to its original decision, just how or by what agency that fire started. As a result of its examination of the record, the Commission found that there was " a good deal of evidence which tends to implicate Kristoff". This</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>107 evidence related to his conduct on the night of the fire, his false alibi, his association and trips with a man whose name the Commission described as " kaleidoscopic " but, for convenience, called Grantnor, as it appeared in the record with many variations of that spelling, and it was attempted in the claimants' evidence to identify this man with a man named Hinsch, an admitted German agent. The record also contained some alleged admissions by Kristoff reported by a private detective named Kassman, employed by the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company. The Commission examined had analyzed at some length all of the evidence and reached the conclusion, stated in its decision, that " We cannot be sure that Kristoff did not set fire to Black Tom or take some part in so doing. We cannot be sure that Graentsor, or Grantnor, or Graentnor was not Hinsch, and that Hinsch did not employ Kristoff and others who are unknown. But it will sufficiently appear from the foregoing that, as we have said, the evidence falls far short of enabling us to reach the point, not merely of holding Germany responsible for the fire, but of thinking that her agents must have been the cause, even though the proof is lacking." The new evidence now submitted on behalf of the claimants is addressed to all of these points in each of these cases, and is intended to show that the Commission was wrong in its findings and conclusions. The American Commissioner and the German Commissioner have been unable to agree upon the decision of the questions presented in these cases as aforesaid, and their respective opinions having been stated to the Umpire they accordingly certify the above mentioned cases and all the questions arising under the supplemental petition therein to the Umpire of the Commission for decision, except that the German Commissioner takes the position that the question of the jurisdiction of the Commission to re-examine any case after a final decision has been rendered is not a proper question to be certified to the Umpire on disagreement of the National Commissioners and reserves that question from this certificate.

<p>W . KlESSELBACH Geiman Commissioner Decision of the Commission rendered by the Umpire, Honoiable Owen J. Roberts These cases are before the Umpire for decision on a certificate of the two National Commissioners, certifying their disagreement. The certificate of the Commissioners briefly describes the pleadings and the purpose of the new evidence submitted. It is unnecessary to repeat what is there set out. I proceed, therefore, without preliminary discussion to deal with the cases in the situation in which I find them. I have had the aid of the transcripts of the very full arguments made before the Commission at The Hague and at Boston and of full and satisfactory briefs filed in connection with the various arguments, especially the present one. I have examined large portions of the evidence filed prior to the decision of October 1G, 1930, with the object of comparing it with the new evidence in order to appraise the new evidence and its effect in connection with the old.</p>

<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERM ANY</h3>
<p>Kingsland Much new evidence has been submitted for the claimants tending to exclude the theory of industrial accident. It goes far to negative the belief that the fire occurred as a result of sparking of machines, undue friction, or disarrange- ment of electrical apparatus. The Commission is asked to draw from these proofs the conclusion that Wozniak intentionally caused the conflagration. The antithesis is between an accidental fire and an incendiary fire set by a German agent. Nothing offered has changed or elaborated the account originally given and steadfastly adhered to by Wozniak. While there is now much contradiction of the alleged improper functioning of the machinery (not testified to by Wozniak, but by others), there is some additional corroboration of Wozniak's story. What was meant in the former opinion by " industrial accident " was one arising from any cause, whether or not accurately ascer- tainable. other than the purposeful act of an incendiary. While the new evidence makes more difficult the inference that the fire was due to one of the causes suggested by Germany, it does not render easier the conclusion that it was intentionally kindled by Wozniak. In the original record Herrmann detailed the instructions he claimed to have given Wozniak. He says he told Wozniak to break the point of the incendiary pencil and set it upright in a coat-pocket or elsewhere and that it would burst into flame within approximately 30 minutes. It is nowsuggested, as a deduction from expert testimony submitted, that if the pencil were laid on its side in the shellcase and crushed a flame would immediately be generated. But there is no evidence that Wozniak knew this or was told that the pencil could be so used. The new evidence as to conditions in the plant and the happenings just before the conflagration, when added to the old, does not warrant a finding that the fire was due to the intentional act of Wozniak. In the decision of the Commission of October 16, 1930, it was found that there was no sufficient proof that Wozniak was a German agent or in the pay of German agents. New evidence has been produced which is said to require a reversal of this finding. It may best be considered in relation to the state of the case as it stood prior to the Commission's decision. Then it was claimed that Hinsch, a German agent, had introduced Wozniak to Herrmann, another German agent, who had given Wozniak incendiary pencils and instructed him in the use of them ; that Herrmann doubted Wozniak's ability and requested that another man be added to the force of incendiaries, whereupon Hinsch produced a man named Rodriguez, who worked at the next bench to that of Wozniak; that after the fire Rodriguez got into touch with Herrmann and was paid $500; that Wozniak disappeared and never claimed any pay but was ultimately taken or went to Mexico, where during the summer of 1917, under the name of Karowski or similar name, he consorted with German agents and was known as a German agent. This version of the transaction depended for its validity in the first place on Herrmann's testimony, which was disbelieved by the Commission, and secondly on that of some six witnesses who said they had either seen or heard of Wozniak in Mexico, under the name Karowski, or Karowsky or Karnowski, and knew him to be a German agent. The Commission disbelieved this testimony. In April, 1929, Wozniak came forward and gave testimony in affidavit form; and was examined and rigorously cross-examined in July, 1930, and gave what the Commission thought a truthful account of the fire and his subsequent conduct. His statements were carefully investigated by the Agents of both countries, and not only by his testimony but by corroborative evidence obtained by the Agents the following facts are indisputably established. After the fire</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>109 he submitted to an examination by the officials of the Agency of Canadian Car and Foundry Company, and also reported the nature and circumstances of the accident to Russian officials: he held himself available for further question- ing. From the time of the fire to July 23, 1917, he was in New York City, using his own name, boarding where he had previously been known, and part of the time a patient and a watchman in a hospital. He says that about August 1 he went to Tupper Lake, N.Y., and worked as a lumberman, returning to New York City sometime about October, 1917. This the American Agent disputes. Contemporaneous records are lacking, and testimony other than that of Wozniak is unsatisfactory as to this period. It is certain, however, that sometime after January 1, 1916, and before Decem- ber 31, 1921, Wozniak did work at Tupper Lake during a portion of a summer. From contemporaneous records and his own testimony it is clear that this was not in 1916. By the weight of the evidence his employment as lumberman was not in the summer of 1918, 1919, 1920, or 1921. If he was not in Tupper Lake in the summer of 1917 my judgment is that he was never there. Yet it is conceded by the American Agent that it is possible he did do summer work there at some time during the period of years mentioned. For reasons which will sufficiently appear from its original opinion the Commission definitely found that Wozniak was not in Mexico in the summer of 1917. Some of the affidavits to that effect presented by the claimants were wholly unsatisfactory in character, and others, while made by persons of the utmost probity, were proved obviously wrong by contemporaneous records. Wozniak was in New York, living with his friends the Perrys and working in Schall's restaurant, early in November, 1917; and from that date forward his whereabouts are accounted for, not alone by his testimony but by undisputed proofs. There is no evidence, except that which the Commission disbelieved on the former hearing, that Wozniak ever used any other than his own name or that, as claimants assert, he purposely disappeared or that claimants could not at any time prior to April, 1929, have located him. With this background, I come to consider the new evidence. This falls under three categories: (1) certain affidavits intended to prove that Wozniak was in fact a German agent; (2) certain letters alleged to have been written by him from St. Louis, Mo., and Mexico City in August and September, 1917, and testimony as to the writing of three other letters by him from Mexico in the summer of that year and as to his taking the name Karowski; (3) the so-called Herrmann message, which will subsequently be described and discussed. I shall consider these items in the order stated.</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1932-1"><span class="para-num">1.</span><p>The affidavit of Capitula is to the effect that in July or August, 1929, Wozniak endeavored to persuade the affiant that he knew Wozniak in Tupper Lake in " 1917 and 1918 "; and that the affiant refused so to state and informed Wozniak that the affiant had been in Tupper Lake in 1920 and 1921. The effect of this deposition is purely negative. The evidence amounts to no more than that the affiant could not say that he had seen Wozniak in Tupper Lake at any time. The witness does, however, add that Wozniak told him he had been in Mexico in " 1917 and 1918." We know nothing of the witness Capitula; his affidavit is barely a page long, lacks any collateral support; it attributes to Wozniak statements which he certainly would never have made as to the year</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1932-1918"><span class="para-num">1918.</span><p>The witness adds the somewhat surprising information that Wozniak told him he had been " brought back " from Mexico. Is the inference to be drawn that German agents brought him back? The affidavit of one Nolan is produced, dated February 6, 1931, in which he says that he knew Wozniak in 1916 and 1917 as a man " used by different German Agents "; that the witness saw Wozniak at Meyer's Hotel, Hoboken,</p></div>

<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>in company with Captain Hinsch. It contains an account of an incredible conversation said to have taken place between Hinsch and Wozniak overheard by the affiant. This witness was presumably always available to the claimants, and it is not clear why his testimony, if favorable, could not have been obtained long before the case was originally submitted. I do not regard this evidence seriously. The same may be said of the affidavit of one King, offered in support of that of Nolan. An additional affidavit by one Palmer was filed. He was in the employ of the British Secret Service during the war and had, prior to the earlier hearing, given evidence apparently quite irrelevant to any issue then or now in the case. And, surprising to relate, he says not a word therein as to the matters to which he now testifies. I must assume that he was thoroughly examined on the former occasion. He now offers a most circumstantial account as to Wozniak and various German agents' activities. He explains that these matters are not disclosed by contemporaneous British Secret Service reports because the custom was to condense them and exclude hearsay; yet the very reports to which he refers do contain hearsay information and on much less important matters than those of which, at this late day, he speaks solely from memory. No explanation is offered for his failure to disclose such vitally relevant details on his former appearance as a witness. One Glucas now furnishes an affidavit in addition to the one he gave origin- ally. He greatly elaborates what he previously said and adds new matter which he says he previously withheld as he thought that the claimants had adequate information on the subjects about which he was interrogated, and so did not need his testimony. His explanations do not satisfy me of his candor. These affidavits are all made with the purpose of attributing to Wozniak the character and designation of a German agent. They are not persuasive, not only for the reasons mentioned, but because I find that, save for the summer of 1917, as to which I shall speak in a moment, Wozniak, though open to surveillance and for a part of the time under actual surveillance, has not in a single instance subsequent to the fire been found in the company of anyone who might by the remotest stretch of the imagination be found to be a German agent.</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1932-2"><span class="para-num">2.</span><p>The new evidence indicates that in May, 1931, a Ukrainian named Baran went to Mr. Peto, vice president of the Agency of Canadian Car and Foundry Company, and exhibited to him three letters, addressed to Baran, written and signed by Wozniak dated respectively St. Louis August 10, 1917, and Mexico City August 28 and September 16, 1917. In connection with the production and examination of these letters the claimants paid Baran $2,500, and procured assent to a condition named by him that the American Agent should give assurance that Wozniak would not be prosecuted for perjury. The American Agent insisted upon an expert examination of the letters before he would accept them as evidence. The claimants consequently had them examined and satisfied themselves and the American Agent that they were in Wozniak's handwriting. Expert opinion indicated also that they were old and had probably been written when they bore date. The letters were submitted to the Commission. If genuine they establish that Wozniak was consorting with Germans in Mexico in the summer of 1917 and destroy his testimony to the effect that he was then in Tupper Lake. If they are not manufactured evidence the Commission was wrong in disbelieving the witnesses offered at the earlier hearing and in finding that Wozniak did not go to Mexico. In my opinion the letters are not authentic. I should arrive at this conclusion without the aid of expert testimony. But my finding is enforced by what I deem convincing expert opinions that they were prepared for the purpose of the case.</p></div>

<h3 class="doc-h3">I 1 1</h3>
<p>They purport to have been written at a time when war had been declared between the United States and Germany, and two of them must have been sent across the border, which was then under strict guard; one of them stated that the Germans did not want Wozniak to write to anyone; two enjoin secrecy on the addressee; one refers to " my Germans ", another to the " damned Germans ", — strange expressions to be used by a German agent consorting with his fellows and seeking to conceal his whereabouts after fleeing the scene of his crime ! They are written in Ukrainian, but one of them contains the name Karowsky written in Roman letters and suggests that Baran write to Wozniak by that name, to the general delivery address in Mexico City. Most noteworthy is the fact that in one Wozniak says that he will soon be back in New York near to " King". This is the sort of admission that Wozniak, above all men, in my judgment, would not naturally or normally have made. The references to Karowski and the Germans and to " King " too well piece out the claimants' theory of the case. I am persuaded from photostats and photographs submitted that when Baran first showed the letters to the claimants they were not in the condition in which they now are. The various photostats prove that subsequent to such exhibition Baran cut a piece out of one of them. After this fact was noticed, the explanation was offered that he did this so that he could have the paper analyzed in an effort to prove the age of the letters because he had heard some discussion between the interested parties as to their authenticity. But Baran, by supposition, had had the letters since 1917; he needed no confirmation of their age. Moreover, photostats of the letters were attached to the affidavit of Baran identifying them, and the photostat of that of August 28, 1917, fails to show certain distinctive stains which are now quite apparent not only on the letter but on all later photostats and photographs of it. The conclusion is irresistible that either Baran or someone else tampered with this letter, in an effort to give it the appearance of age, after it was first shown to claimants and before it was delivered to them by Baran to be used as evidence. These stains are relied upon by claimants' experts as evidence of the age of the letters. Certain foldings of two of the letters (those of August 10, 1917, and September 16, 1917) are totally inconsistent with the claim that these were written on the dates they bear and separately mailed from the places they bear date. Baran, who produced the documents, is an intimate friend of Wozniak. The record before the Commission at the previous hearing discloses that he was repeatedly in touch with Wozniak. His identity was fully disclosed prior to July 30, 1930, by Wozniak's testimony. From the cross-examination for the claimants it is evident that they knew of this relationship at that time. It is incredible that Baran was not interviewed between the summer of 1930 and May, 1931, when he appeared and offered the letters. If he had such letters, that fact could have been long before ascertained. The expert evidence and my own inspection convince me that the letters show all the characteristics of artificially aged documents and that the expla- nation offered by claimants' experts of accidental staining is not credible. The letter of August 28, 1917, was written upon a watermarked paper sold by Kiperman, a merchant of Warsaw. As early as June, 1931, the claimants had observed the watermark and had procured a transmitted-light photograph which showed it with great clearness and definition of detail. During the sum- mer and autumn of 1931 they made investigations in Poland, and in France where a dandy-roll for the production of such a watermark had been manu- factured, to ascertain the date of the manufacture of the paper. The investi- gation was not exhaustive, and made at best but a prima facie case for a date of the watermarked paper earlier than 1926. Kiperman's unsworn statement</p>
<p>1 1 2</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>went no farther than that he had for many years sold paper with a similar watermark; it is quite indefinite as to when such paper was manufactured. Much detailed evidence submitted by the German Agent demonstrates that the watermarked paper in question was not manufactured prior to 1926. Some confusion has been created, due to the fact that two manufacturers made paper for Kiperman with dandy-rolls procured from different makers, but non-expert inspection demonstrates to my satisfaction that the watermark in question is that made by the Mirkow factory from a dandy-roll made in Paris. The paper made by the use of that dandy-roll was delivered to Kiperman not earlier than 1926. The expert testimony supports my own independent conclusion on this point. The watermark, therefore, strongly corroborates the other matters which make against the authenticity of the documents. In June, 1932, there was filed an affidavit by one Golka, of Scranton, Pa., dated December 9, 1931, in which he states that he received a letter from Wozniak in Mexico in 1917. At the same time two affidavits by one Panas and his wife of about the same date were filed, in which they recount the receipt of two letters from Wozniak postmarked in Mexico. Supporting affidavits state that the names of these witnesses were obtained in Europe by Mr. McLain, one of the attorneys for claimants, and that Mr. McCloy, another attorney for claimants, secured the same names by independent investigation in this country. But the record contains references to both of these persons. In the cross-examination of Wozniak he was questioned and testified at length with respect to them. It appears from his affidavit and oral testimony that he worked under Golka in Scranton before going to New York in 1916, that during the same period he lived in the house of Panas in Scranton and that Panas was a witness to his marriage. It is somewhat difficult, therefore, to understand the necessity for all this investigation to disclose these two persons, who perhaps are as close to Wozniak and know him as well as Baran and who would be the natural persons to whom he and Baran would turn for statements in support of the Baran letters. Let it be here noted that, though unquestionably Wozniak wrote the Baran letters, he has testified that he was not in Mexico in 1917, has not vouched for the letters, and is not to be prosecuted for perjury. If the affidavits of Golka and Panas had been submitted independently, not merely as corroboration of the fraudulent Baran letters, I might, perhaps, give greater credence to the evidence of Wozniak's friends. These affidavits contain erroneous statements of fact ; and, moreover, both recite that Wozniak was anxious to have his letters from Mexico destroyed. In one case he is said so to have requested in the letter; in another case to have visited the addressee, obtained the letters, and destroyed them in the presence of his friends. The reason Golka says he gave was that he wished to conceal whence he was writing. These are remarkable statements, when contrasted with the facts as to the fraudulent letters produced by Baran, which contain no such request but in fact give the name and address in Mexico to which letters may be sent to Wozniak. If he were so anxious that his correspondence be destroyed, I can not understand why he did not make a similar and effective request of his friend Baran, if the Baran letters were genuine and the Golka and Panas affidavits exhibit his true attitude. Some of the witnesses who, prior to the decision of October 16, 1930, testified to Wozniak's presence in Mexico in 1917 identified a photograph of him as that of a man they knew as Karowski. Others stated they knew of the presence of a German agent known as Kurowski, Karnowski, etc., without identifying Wozniak as the one who bore that name. In the new evidence there is a certificate by a police official in Poland to the effect that bordering on Wozniak's old home in Rawa Russka there is a forest in which Wozniak once worked,</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>113 called the " Karowski " forest; that in Poland it is common to take a name additional to the surname, and to derive it from one's surroundings; that it is therefore probable that Wozniak did this, in which case he might have called himself Wozniak-Karowski or Karowski-Wozniak. This evidence is pressed upon me as confirmatory of the testimony that Wozniak was in Mexico under the alia1: of Karowski. But it rises no higher than proof that such a thing is neither improbable nor impossible. On the other hand, testimony produced by Germany tends to prove that in the tongue used in Rawa Russka the forest in question was, prior to Polish domination at least, called " Kariw " (thus its derivative would be " Karifski " or " Karivsky "); that an intimate friend never knew of Wozniak's living in Kariw or working in the forest in question and never heard him use or anyone else call him or his family Karowsky or any similar name. This state of the proofs does not give me any real light upon the question of Wozniak's presence in Mexico. I am of opinion the matters above discussed are insufficient, when taken with the proofs offered before the final hearing, to alter the finding that there is no credible evidence that Wozniak was a German agent, was connected and con- sorted with German agents, or that he was in Mexico in 1917.</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1932-3"><span class="para-num">3.</span><p>If the so-called Herrmann message is authentic, that document alone would compel a finding contrary to that I have just stated so far as concerns Wozniak's being a German agent. Since, however, that message applies equally to Kingsland and to Black Tom, I may postpone discussion of it until after I have considered the other new evidence relating to Black Tom. Blark Tom With respect to this catastrophe the decision of October 16, 1930, held that while not satisfied that Kristoff did not have a part in causing the fire and explosions, neither was the Commission convinced that he did have such part or that he was a German agent or an employee of German agents. The opinion states that the Black Tom Terminal was a shining mark for the activities of agents of destruction and that Hinsch might well have desired its destruction; but the only matter from which the Commission thought it might infer a connection between Kristoff and Hinsch was the former's story of a journey made by him with a man named Graentnor (or some similar name) early in 1916 and the promise of a large payment from this person. The Commission was unable from the record to identify Hinsch with Graentnor which it felt it must do in order to hold that Kristoff acted for Germany in causing the explosion. The new evidence offered in the endeavor to clarify the situation and to induce an affirmative finding falls into two classes: (1) the 1916 diary and certain checkbooks of Hilken; (2) the Herrmann message.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1932-1"><span class="para-num">1.</span><p>It is said that the entries in the diary are consistent with Hinsch's having been absent from Baltimore on a trip with Kristoff in the spring of 1916. In the earlier arguments it was contended that, as Kristoff claimed to have made a trip at the time in question with a man he called Graentsor and as Fesmire testified that Hinsch had once told him about having made a trip west, the Commission should conclude that Hinsch was Graentnor. Hinsch, on the other hand, testified that he had never been west of Gettysburg and never made such a trip as the one described and had never visited some of the cities mentioned by Kristoff. In this state of the record the Commission refused to draw the conclusion suggested. In the light of these facts, I find merely that the entries in Hilken's diary are not inconsistent with Hinsch's having made the</p></div>
<p>1 14</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>trip but they add nothing affirmative to the evidence as contained in the record before and are insufficient to induce the affirmative finding asked by the claimants. With respect to Hilken's checkbook it is urged that this now makes certain what has heretofore been a matter of dispute, namely, that in August, 1916, shortly after the Black Tom explosion, Hilken paid $2,000 to Hinsch ; that this fact destroys Hinsch's testimony that no such payment was made and casts discredit on the whole of his evidence. The check stub shows that on August 10, 1916, Hilken drew $2,000 in cash; on the stub is noted " Capt H — Lewis, etc." Herrmann used the alias Lewis. It is undoubted that about August 6 or 7 Hilken, Hinsch, and Herrmann went to New London to inspect the harbor preparatory to making it a merchant-submarine base. I think that if Hilken was in New York on August 10 he was on his return trip from New London. The new harbor project undoubtedly required disbursements of money. Hinsch states that the did not get S2,000 at this time and that the only expla- nation he can give of the entry on the check stub is that part of the money may have been used for the expenses of the trip to New London, but he concedes that these would not require anything like 552,000. This testimony is said to brand him as untruthful. I can not adopt this view. The use to which the money was to be put still must be derived by the claimants from Hilken's testi- mony, heretofore given, contradicted as it is by Hinsch. I am asked to conclude that as Kristoffsaid that he was to go to the Hotel McAlpin and meet Graentnor about August 10 to receive a payment of a large sum of money this entry connects Hinsch and Kristoff's travelling companion Graentnor. But here again we are taken into the realm of conjecture. Kristoff, moreover, said he did not receive any money, and there is nothing else, unless the check stub be evidence of the fact, to show that he did. I find that the diary entries and the check stubs do not warrant the inferences I am asked to draw from them. The Herrmann Message</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1932-2"><span class="para-num">2.</span><p>On July 1, 1931, there was filed with the Commission a Blue Book maga- zine of the January, 1917, issue, containing upon four printed pages lines of writing running crosswise of the print. This, we are told, is a code message forwarded by Fred Herrmann in Mexico to Paul Hilken in Baltimore in April 1917: names being referred to by numbers in the script, the numbers referring to other pages of the magazine where the names were indicated by pin pricks through printed letters in the text. The writing fluid is said to be lemon-juice made visible by the application of heat. As decoded by Hilken the message reads : Have seen Eckhardt he is suspicious of me Can't convince him I come from Maguerre and Nadolny Have told him all reference Hinsch and I Deutschland, Jersey City Terminal, Kingsland, Savannah, and Tony's Lab. he doubts me on account of my bum German Confirm to him thru your channels all O.K. and my mission here I have no funds Eckhardt claims he is short of money send ly [by] bearer U.S. 25000.— Have you heard from Willie Have wired Hildegard but no answer Be careful of her and connections Where are Hinsch and Carl Ahrendt Tell Hinsch to come here I expect to go north but he can locate me thru Eckhardt I dont trust Carl Ahrendt, Kristoff, Wolfgang and that Hoboken bunch If cornered they might get us in Dutch with authorities See that Hinsch brings with him all who might implicate us tell him Siegel is with me.

Most important send funds Bearer will relate experiencies and details Greetings. A glance through this translation will indicate that, without reference to any other evidence, it is conclusive proof to any reasonable man that (a) Herrmann and Hilken knew the Kingsland fire and the Black Tom explosion were the work of German agents and (b) that Hinsch, Hilken, and Herrmann, undoubted agents, were privy thereto, and (in the light of the record before the Commission) (e) that Kristoff and Wozniak were active participants in these events. As the American Agent has well said, I may utterly disregard all the new evidence produced and still, if I deem this message genuine, hold Germany responsible in both of the cases. The authenticity of the message is sharply challenged. A narrow and very difficult issue of fact, upon which alone these cases now turn, is thus raised, which challenges and has had my careful and painstaking study in an effort to reach a right solution. As in the case of the Wozniak letters, the elements which affect the problem of authenticity fall into three general classes: (1) the testimony concerning the document, (2) the conditions known to exist when the message is claimed to have been transmitted, and (3) expert testimony with regard tho the probable date of the writing. (1) The magazine was produced by Paul Hilken, who, in an affidavit of May 8, 1931, states that he discovered it recently in his old home in Baltimore. The document comes, therefore, from a source which the former opinion of the Commission entirely discredited. Hilken, though an American citizen, is a former German agent. His attitude at first was that of loyalty to Germany. In December, 1928, he changed his position and testified at great length on behalf of the claimants. He then produced, upon request, diaries for 1915 and 1917 and part of 1916 and other documents which were made a part of his deposition. He then expressed his willingness to search for other contempo- raneous documents and indicated that they would be found either in his desk or at this former home in Baltimore. The record leaves no doubt that the American Agent and his counsel for a period of two years prior to the production of the magazine had urged Hilken to search out further data in substantiation of his testimony. Notwithstanding this he did not do so, and the Commission made its finding of October 16, 1930, branding him unworthy of belief. There- after counsel to the American Agent renewed his request and apparently hoped that Hilken might find further documents to reestablish him in the eyes of the Commission. Nothing came of this until April 26, 1931, on or about which date, we are told, Hilken brought the Blue Book to Mr. Peto, vice president of the Agency of Canadian Car and Foundry Company, and not, be it noted, to the American Agent or his counsel who had requested further data. Mr. Peto advised the American Agent of the existence of the document. Not until long after the German Agent had attacked the authenticity of the message was further testimony of Hilken filed as to the time and manner of the discovery of the magazine. In an affidavit made November 15, 1932, Hilken states that on Christmas Day, 1930, he made a search of the attic of his old home in Baltimore and unearthed the magazine at the bottom of a wooden box in a closet under the eaves, and at the same time discovered a large amount of correspondence bearing on his wartime activities. Apparently none of this other matter was.</p>
<p>116</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>delivered to the claimants with the magazine, but was filed with a later affidavit of Hilken dated June 29, 1931. Along with Hilken's affidavit of November 15, 1932, were filed affidavits bearing date November 12 and 15, by Mrs. Hilken, Hilken's daughter, and Elizabeth Braun. Mrs. Hilken states " she knows " that on Christmas Day, 1930, Hilken found the magazine, though did not tell her of the message, but did inform her daughter as to it. She does not say that she ever saw the document. The daughter simply underwrites her mother's deposition; fails to state that she ever saw the document; and simply narrates by proxy of her mother's affidavit what her father told her. Elizabeth Braun, who is in no way identified to the Commission, — about whom we know nothing except for her name and address, that she is an old friend of the Hilkens, and that she entertained Hilken the Sunday following Christmas, 1930, — says that Hilken told her of the finding of an important message and described it ; she does not say that she saw it. All of these witnesses seem to have communi- cated the contents of their affidavits to the claimants during early or late 1931, but their testimony was not submitted to the Commission until November 15,1932. Hilken, in his deposition of November 15, 1932, and not before, gives as his reason for not promptly producing the message on its discovery, that he feared publicity as he knew that certain articles were being prepared on the sabotage cases to appear in the Liberty magazine ; also that he was being urged by von Rintelen, then in this country, not to give any further evidence for the United States. It is quite evident that Hilken had fully determined to aid the claimants as early as December, 1928. I do not believe that his attitude in that respect had undergone any change. The von Rintelen advice is in my judgment a belated excuse. Equally unsatisfactory is the suggestion as to avoidance of publicity. It is quite evident that Hilken could promptly have confidentially exhibited or delivered the magazine to the American Agent or his counsel, and that his confidence would have been respected. As respects the production of the message, I find that it comes from a source which the Commission has held unworthy of belief, and under circumstances which at least cause me to hesitate to give full faith and credit to the account of its discovery. In addition to Hilken's several depositions, there is a substantial amount of other testimony to be considered. Raoul Gerdts, a young man who associated with Fred Herrmann in New York in 1916-1917 and who, while not a German agent, was an employee of Herrmann and did various errands and services for him, accompanied the latter from the United States to Mexico in February,</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1932-1917"><span class="para-num">1917.</span><p>Gerdts separated from Herrmann in 1917 and returned to his mother's home in Colombia, South America. About January, 1929, the claimants located him there and submitted a questionnaire or series of interrogatories to him, which he answered in writing. Amongst other things, he was interrogated as to whether he knew Hinsch and Hilken. In his answers he said that he had met them in Baltimore in the spring of 1917 when he delivered the message or order with which he had been dispatched by Herrmann who was then in Mexico. His testimony convinces me that he knew neither of them prior to the Baltimore meeting. He said that he carried two messages, one for Hop- penberg (of the Eastern Forwarding Company in New York) and another to be delivered to Hilken in case he should not find Hoppenberg ; that these were written in lemon-juice in a book of poetry. When his testimony was given and filed apparently the parties, and certainly the Commission, attached no im- portance to the message, which seemed to be of a date insignificant in respect of the issues in these cases. In 1930, after Fred Herrmann had decided to give evidence in support of the claims and to return from Chile for that purpose, he remarked during the</p></div>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>1 1 7 course of his evidence that he had sent " a couple of letters " from Mexico to Hilken in Baltimore. Nothing further transpired in this connection until the production by Hilken of the Blue Book magazine on April 26, 1931. There- upon Herrmann testified that he recognized it as " the message " which he had sent by the hands of Gerdts to Hilken in April, 1917. We need only note in passing the Commission's former finding that Herrmann is a liar not pre- sumptive but proved. A German named Siegel was interned in Russia at the outbreak of the war. He escaped through Siberia and may have crossed the Pacific and been in the United States for some time. He was then apparently unknown to Herrmann. He made his way to Cuba, and when Herrmann and Gerdts, after leaving the United States, stopped at Havana and thence took passage for Mexico they made his acquaintance, and he accompanied them into Mexico and remained with them. Siegel had not theretofore been a German agent but professed his desire to do something for Germany and volunteered to cooperate with Herrmann. Herrmann offered him employment in behalf of Germany. Siegel was present when a secret message was written by Herrmann to be dispatched by Gerdts. It seems that Herrmann prepared a draft of a message and had Siegel read it to him while he wrote it in invisible fluid. After the war Siegel returned to Europe and is now engaged in a mercantile business in Estonia. It will be noted that the Herrmann message contains the phrase " Siegel is with me ". In March, 1932, the claimants sent Herrmann, who was cooper- ating with them, to Europe to obtain a statement from Siegel. Although an American lawyer for the claimants, Mr. McLain, accompanied Herrmann to Tallinn for this purpose, neither Mr. McLain's presence nor his identity was disclosed to Siegel, and the negotiations were left entirely to Herrmann. There is no question that Herrmann failed to make a full and frank disclosure of the situation in which Siegel's testimony was desired. So much both he and McLain admit. How much Herrmann concealed and what he actually told Siegel is a matter of serious dispute between him and Siegel. That he purported to refresh Siegel's memory as to details T think there is no doubt. As a result of the interviews, Siegel prepared in his own hand a statement in which he said that he had been shown a Blue Book magazine; that he recog- nized the volume as similar to that in which the message of 1917 had been writ- ten ; had been shown a photostat of the alleged secret message as developed ; that he dictated the same to Herrmann and that Herrmann dispatched it by the hands of Gerdts. Siegel was subsequently examined on behalf of Germany and then gave a sworn statement in which he says that he thought the paper which he had written was merely to be used in negotiation by the German Foreign Office; that he understood that Herrmann was still in the German service, was being paid by the German Foreign Office, and that it would help Herrmann if he made the statement as he did; that he relied largely upon Herrmann for details and that as a matter of fact he does not carry the details in his memory at the present time. Finally, upon November 15, 1932, an affidavit of date October 28, 1932, by one van Emmerik was filed. In this the witness states that Gerdts arrived in New York City in April, 1917, as Gerdts says in his testimony, on the day after the death of Hoppenberg ; that Gerdts inquired for Hoppenberg and on learning that he was dead stated that he would now have to find Hilken; that Gerdts was dressed in a raincoat and was carrying a magazine which he said contained a message for Hoppenberg. The implication is that the magazine was open and exposed to the elements. The witness says he, Gerdts, and one Weber had a meal together in a restaurant in New York, where Gerdts</p>
<p>1 18</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>laid the magazine on the table and a waiter picked it up and tore the cover (the front cover is now missing), and that Weber got greatly excited about the incident and insisted on checking the magazine. With respect to what happened in Baltimore the claimants' evidence is to this effect: Gerdts who had arrived by devious ways in order to avoid surveil- lance says he found that Hilken's home was then being inspected by special investigators and was sent away for a time until that inspection should be completed; he returned and met Hilken; Hilken went alone to the cellar and developed the message. Hilken says that upon reading the message he made a translation of it by the use of the code and took this to New London and showed it to Hinsch, that Hinsch returned to Baltimore with him, and there they discussed the situation with Gerdts. All agree that this conference between these three took place. In the upshot, Gerdts was given about $1,000 and was told that Hinsch would bring additional money when he went to Mexico, and Gerdts was sent back to Herrmann. Hinsch did, in May, 1917, go to Mexico carrying some $24,000. The German evidence in contradiction to this testimony is that of Hinsch, who says that a secret message was sent by Herrmann to Hilken, that he was summoned to Baltimore by Hilken to consider the matter, that there he met Gerdts, and that he and Hilken questioned Gerdts and learned from him about the situation in Mexico and that it was determined that Gerdts should be given a comparatively small sum and that Hinsch would take further funds to Mexico later when he went. Hinsch says that the message was in a bound book in stiff covers, was written in a secret ink which was then known to German agents, was developed by bathing in a known solution, and was on but a single page which was the fly-leaf from the front or back of the book and contained no print. He says that the message was of but two or three sentences, — as well as he can now remember, somewhat to the following effect: " The bearer of this message is Raoul Gerdts who carries a personal message to you. You can trust him in full." And then followed the request that Hilken give Gerdts a considerable sum (the witness thinks it was twenty or twenty-five thousand dollars) and also a statement that Gerdts would verbally report about every- thing else. (2) As to the circumstances and the internal evidence: It is to be borne in mind that the conceded purpose of the message was to obtain funds. So far as I am advised it had no other. It is further to be noted that at the time of its dispatch the United States had entered the war ; most of the secret agents of Germany had left the country and were known in many instances to have fled to Mexico; the border was being watched for secret correspondence; the situation was so tense that Hilken was under actual surveillance and his home was being searched. Again, the missive was written in lemon-juice, a medium well-known and for many years used for secret messages, was in a code which could be discovered and the text read by any agent of the United States or of the Allies in perhaps an hour after its capture, contained a sentence in German which would have been indicative of its origin and destination. The document comprises 254 words. Those that have to do with the request for money amount to only 20. All the remainder are wholly irrelevant to the purpose in hand. The names of 21 separate persons and places appear; all but two admittedly names of alleged German agents, asserted by the claimants in these cases to be such, or of places where acts of sabotage are said by the claimants to have been committed by German agents. The two persons on whom principal reliance is placed for the identification and substantiation of the message are Herrmann and Hilken, who in the spring of 1931 unquestionably were thoroughly familiar with all of the facts and data</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>1 1 9 developed before the Commission. The record contains a cablegram from von Eckhardt, German Minister to Mexico, to the German Foreign Office stating that he distrusted Herrmann and requesting confirmation of Herrmann's capacity and personality. This fact is referred to at the opening of the Herr- mann message and is made the occasion, wholly unnecessarily, for the recital of the substance of the argument made by Herrmann to convince von Eckhardt. In this narration Marguerre and Nadolny, Hinsch and Herrmann are mentioned, as are the Deutschland, the Jersey City Terminal (obviously Black Tom), Kingsland, Savannah (where acts of sabotage against horses and mules are shown by claimants' evidence to have been committed), and Tony's Lab. (the name of Anton Dilger's laboratory for producing toxic germs, all as ex- plained in other evidence in the record). It was surely unnecessary after having said Eckhardt distrusted him to append a biography and history of German agents and sabotage activities in the United States as detailed to von Eckhardt. The message names Kristoff, but Herrmann has testified he did not know any such person and did not recognize his photograph. It names Wozniak, and tells Hilken to tell Hinsch to see Wozniak and " fix that up "; this comports with Herrmann's previous testimony that Wozniak failed to show up and claim his reward after the Kingsland fire. It refers to Hildegard. We find that long before the message was produced there was evidence before the Commission that Hildegard Jacobson had received a telegram from Herrmann in Mexico, endeavored to reply and failed to get through to him. It goes on to inquire what Hilken will do, now that America is in the war, inquires if he were coming to Mexico or going to South America, advises him to leave the United States and to get all German agents out of the United States. It mentions " Carl D." and says that from past experience the writer does not trust him; this refers to an incident long before exposed in the record, namely, that during 1916 Hilken became distrustful of Carl Dilger and sent him to Germany in 1916 carrying a secret written request to the German authorities to detain him there, but that Dilger, supposing the message to contain military secrets, became alarmed and threw the message into the sea, thus defeating Hilken's purpose. There are other references equally significant to one familiar with the evidence and the arguments based thereon, previously submitted to the Commission. But enough has been said to show in how extraordinary a manner this document dovetails with all the important and disputed points of claimants' case and how pat all these references are, not to the request for funds but to the claim- ants' points of proof, — this aside from the absurdity of sending this unneces- sary information into an enemy country to a suspected spy then under surveillance. I come now to a new fact which is of importance. When the Blue Book was filed with the Commission the last page of reading matter had been torn out. Apparently Hilken took no note of this fact, nor did Herrmann. Ap- parently the American Agent failed to note the condition. So far as we can determine, this excision of the last page was not discovered until the summer of 1932. When Herrmann and Hilken were originally examined respecting what the magazine had contained, they definitely gave the impression that there was but one message. Hilken, in the affidavit originally filed with the Blue Book, definitely states that the code in which the message was written was one which he knew and which had been prearranged between him and Herrmann for their communications. After the discovery of the missing page, Hilken testified that it contained an additional message which gave the key to the code and that he accordingly destroyed it immediately; but, remarkable to relate, he retained the main message, which he had made legible, in his files and went so far, as above stated, as to make a fair copy of it which he carried</p>

<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>to New London to show Hinsch. Siegel does not mention any second message. It is difficult from the testimony to draw any conclusion as to whether there was an additional message and what it in fact contained if it ever existed. Another matter of note is that the January, 1917, Blue Book, when filed with the Commission, concededly bore certain marks in lead pencil opposite some of the titles of the stories on the index pages. These apparently went unnoticed by Hilken or Herrmann or the American Agent. Some time after the submission of the magazine the German Agent observed them. He sub- sequently bought a number of other issues of the Blue Book for other months of the year 1917 to be used for comparison and for the use of his expert. These he procured from Abraham's Book Store in New York. They contained similar marks. In several of them were found bills which indicated that the magazines had been delivered by a newsdealer in Brooklyn to a house at 756 Madison Street in Brooklyn. Further investigation developed that one Qualters lived in that house and had in 1930 sold a large number of Blue Book, Red Book, and Adventure magazines to Abraham's Book Store and had received a check for $12 in payment therefor. The evidence, in my judgment, is entirely conclusive that Qualters did make such a sale, but it is not clear that he sold complete sets of all three magazines covering the years from 1911 to 1929 as he states. Subsequently both Agents purchased at Abraham's Book Store numerous magazines of the kinds mentioned. Sixteen of all those purchased contained horizontal marks and cross- marks on the index pages; some 53 of them contained only horizontal marks. The German Agent seeks to prove by the Qualters' testimony that these marks were made by Horace Qualters and John Qualters, his brother, when and as they read the articles marked. He seeks also to account for the absence of marks during a certain period by the fact that Horace was absent during the war and was not reading the magazines currently. Qualters identifies the horizontal marks in the January issue as so like his that he believes he made them. It appears that sometime prior to April 30, 1931, two persons purchased January, 1917, Blue Books at Abraham's Book Store. One of them is now identified as Mr. Traynor, who bought a copy on April 29, 1931, for the claimants, in order to obtain a magazine to compare with the one produced by Hilken. This copy contains no marks whatever on the index pages. The other was bought by someone who cannot be identified, whose description is most vague, the time of whose appearance at the store cannot be definitely fixed, but who. according to the testimony, did not ask for the issue of any particular month but merely for a Blue Book of 1917 and was handed a January number only because the store had two copies of that issue and could better afford to sell one of the copies for that month than to break the set by taking one of another month. Meyers and Abraham, of the bookstore, who had to do with the sales in question, do not identify Hilken or Herrmann as the purchaser of the January, 1917, Blue Book. There is no specific evidence that Herrmann, Hilken, or any agent employed by them or either of them purchased the January, 1917, number of the magazine at the Abraham Book Store. Expert evidence which is not effectively challenged is to the effect that the marks as exhibited in the 1917 Blue Books and in that containing the message were not made in the order and in the manner described by the two Qualters brothers. The German Agent, however, insists that the markings found on the table of contents of the magazine containing the Herrmann message are so similar to the markings in the other magazines, some of which indubitably and concededly come from the lot purchased by the bookstore from Horace Qualters, that I may draw the conclusion that the January, 1917, magazine</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>1 2 1 containing the message came from Quakers. He further animadverts upon the tardy explanations of Hilken that German agents were in the habit of using marks as keys to their codes, and of Herrmann that he believes he made the marks in the table of contents in the magazine in connection with the message to Hilken but cannot at this time determine their significance. If I were to draw the conclusion the German Agent desires, this would end the controversy with respect to the authenticity of the message. While the evidence arouses suspicion, I can not find in it alone enough to reach a certain conclusion. It does, however, add to the doubts which all the other facts and circumstances recited have raised concerning the document. (3) It remains to consider whether these doubts can be resolved by recourse to the expert testimony. This consists of about one thousand pages. The questions submitted to the experts are in my belief novel. They involve at the foundation certain known qualities of ink and paper. But as one reads the testimony on both sides one is impressed with the fact that the experts themselves had to resort to experiments with lemon-juice writing on new and old paper in order to reach their conclusions. Many of the opinions of the experts on the one side are countered by diametrically opposite results stated by those on the other. I agree with the arguments of both Agents that certain of the expe- riments and tests which they criticize are not beyond fair criticism and fail to carry conviction. I entertain no doubt that all the experts retained by both litigants were inspired by a desire to do their honest best with a very difficult problem. Both sets of experts evidently believe in the soundness of their conclusions, for they challenge the Commission to make certain experiments and examinations for itself, and it is hardly conceivable that they would do so unless they felt that the results of such experimentation by laymen would justify their confidence. My experience in this behalf has, however, been most unsatisfactory and has only tended to confirm the feeling that on the expert evidence alone my judgment would be left in balance as to the authenticity of the document. Expert evidence is often an aid in determining questions of the sort here presented ; but is it far from an infallible guide, as witness the fact that several of the experts for the claimants convinced themselves of the authenticity of the Wozniak letters. This comment does not by any means apply to all of the experts who testify about the Herrmann message, and it is not to be taken as indicating that I have the slightest doubt that all of the expert's opinions are honestly entertained. It is mentioned merely as an illustration of the fact above stated, that, at best, expert evidence can usually be only an aid to judgment, and not always in and of itself so conclusive as to carry conviction. I need only add in summary that the most careful study and consideration of the expert evidence with respect to the Blue Book message convinces me that upon that evidence alone I should not be justified in affirming the authen- ticity of the document. I am therefore compelled to revert to the other evidence. As has been indicated, the testimony offered on both sides with respect to the message, to say the least, raises grave doubts with regard to it. The sources from which it comes, the circumstances of its production, the evidence as to the time and circumstances in which it was written, and the silent but persuasive intrinsic evidence which is drawn from its contents, make impossible an affirmative conclusion in favor of the claimants and against Germany. The claimants have the burden to establish, by a fair preponderance of evidence, that this document was written and sent at the time claimed. With every disposition to avoid technicality, to be liberal as to the interpretation and effect of evidence, and to regard the great difficulties under which the claimants have labored in the production of their proofs, I yet find myself unable to</p>
<p>122</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>overcome the natural doubts and misgivings which cluster about this document. I am not, therefore, prepared to make a finding that this is the missive which Herrmann dispatched to Hilken in 1917. It results from what has been said that with respect to the Black Tom ex- plosion the new proof, when taken in connection with the old, fails to support any finding that Kristoff was a German agent or the employee of any German agent or agents ; and fails also to justify a finding that Hinsch is the same person as Graentnor. As respects the Kingsland case, the evidence does not, in my judgment, justify a finding that Wozniak was a German agent or employed by any German agent; does not justify a finding that excludes accident and affirms incendiarism. It leaves me still of the opinion that Wozniak was not in Mexico in the summer of 1917. There is therefore no sufficient basis for a finding against Germany. It must be borne in mind that whatever may be the belief of any Member of the Commission with respect to Germany's general attitude and the motives or purposes of its agents, or with respect to the equities of the claimants, or that Germany is disentitled to favorable consideration by reason of her general policy as to American-made munitions and supplies for the Allies, this tribunal sits as a court with the obligation to ignore any such considerations and, how- ever liberally construing rules of evidence, is still bound to act only upon proof which reasonably leads to the conclusions upon which liability is consequent. A matter upon which the Commissioners disagree is that of the jurisdiction of the Commission ever under any circumstances or for any reason to reopen a claim made under the international agreement of August 10, 1922, which created the Commission, once that claim has been formally passed upon and decided. The German Commissioner's position is that while the two Com- missioners by mutual agreement may reopen in such a situation they may not do so where, as here, one of the Commissioners opposes the reopening. The German Commissioner does so oppose in this case. The conclusions I have expressed make it unnecessary to pass upon the question just stated. Equally unnecessary is it, in view of the foregoing, to discuss whether the evidence offered, or some of it, falls within the class of evidence properly denominated after-discovered. As it is my opinion that if the new evidence were formally placed on file and considered in connection with the whole body of evidence submitted prior to the Commission's opinion ol October 16, 1930, the findings then made and the conclusions then reached would not be reversed or materially modified, the question as to our jurisdiction need not be answered. The supplemental petition for rehearing is dismissed. Done at Washinghton December 3, 1932. OwenJ. ROBERTS Umpire Concurring: W . KlESSELBACH German Commissioner Dec. 3, 1932.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>123 December 2, 1932 Separate Opinion on the Kingsland Case by the American Commissioner As to the Kingsland Case, I agree with the finding of the Commission that the three so-called Wozniak letters are manufactured evidence fabricated after the dates when they purport to have been written, and have no value as evidence for the purposes for which they were produced. Nevertheless, I draw from the production of these letters certain conclusions which have an important bearing on some of the other evidence in this case. Wozniak's authorship of these letters, although not admitted by him so far as the record discloses, can be taken as established for the purposes of this case. They are admittedly in his handwriting and they came to the American Agent through his closest friend, one Ivan Baran, who refused to surrender them until he had received an assurance from the American Agent granting Wozniak immunity from prosecution for incendiarism or perjury. This whole transaction shows a degree of cleverness and subtlety on the part of Wozniak which was not suspected by the Commission at the time of its original decision. Considering that these letters were so skillfully fabricated that they deceived several of the American Agent's most experienced and trusted experts as to their date of production, judged by physical condition and appearance, and also deceived the American Agent and his counsel as to their trustworthiness, judged by their textual contents, and considering also that the claimants paid 82,500 for them without Wozniak himself having vouched for their authenticity, while Wozniak at the same time obtained an assurance of immunity from prosecution on account of their bearing on the Kingsland fire or perjury charges, it is evident that the Commission's earlier estimate of Wozniak's mentality, as described in its original decision, must be revised. The Commission then said of Wozniak, " He is in a way smart, though naive, and thinks he is smarter than he really is." He has now demon- strated that he is really smarter than the Commission thought he was, and also that he is even less trustworthy and more formidable and mercenary as a witness than the Commission then assumed him to be. It follows from this conclusion that Wozniak's testimony before the Commission, at the time of the original decision, was given more weight than was justified. In fact, Wozniak has disclosed by his present performance that he is thoroughly untrustworthy as a witness. The Commission's original finding that Wozniak was not in Mexico at the time he was alleged by other witnesses to have been there in association with German agents rests wholly on Wozniak's own statements. So, also, his alibi story that he was at Tupper Lake, New York, at the time he was reported by other witnesses to have been in Mexico, cannot be accepted if his own statements about it are not accepted. The Commission accepted his statements on these points in reliance upon his assumed credibility. If, however, his credibility is now destroyed by the newly submitted evidence, both of these points are open for reexamination, and the examination should be unprejudiced by the earlier findings of the Commission. In the original decision, the question of whether or not Wozniak was in Mexico was really a minor issue and immaterial for the decision of the case, in view of the facts found by the Commission as to the cause of the Kingsland fire. In the present proceedings, however, the question whether or not Wozniak was in Mexico in 1917 is one of the essential issues in its bearing upon his status</p>
<p>124</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>as a German agent, the decision of which may determine the validity of the claim. In its earlier decision the Commission adopted the theory that the Kingsland fire was the result of an accident, and was not purposely set by Wozniak, so that whether or not he was a German agent was unimportant. In that decision the Commission stated, " Despite Herrmann's confession, the evidence in the Kingsland case has convinced us that Wozniak did not set the Kingsland fire ", and expressed the opinion that the fire was caused by sparks from the machine which held the shell Wozniak was cleaning, in other words, that the fire was an industrial accident. The basis of this finding was Wozniak's own story taken in connection with the evidence embodied in the so-called Johnson report. The new evidence submitted in the present proceeding shows that this Johnson report, like the Wozniak letters, was fabricated and must now be rejected. It was put into the record by the German Agent only shortly before the Hague argument, too late to be investigated by the American Agent before the Commission's decision, and both the German Agent and the Commission unwittingly relied upon its authenticity. By a curious coincidence, that report, like one of the Wozniak letters, was written on paper which, by its watermark, was proved not to have been manufactured until after the date on which it purported to have been written. This report being spurious, and Wozniak himself having been discredited, there is nothing in the record, as the case now stands, to support a finding that the Kingsland fire was the result of an industrial accident. On the contrary, voluminous affidavits and reports have now been submitted negativing the possibility of an industrial accident. Accordingly, the question of whether or not Wozniak was a German agent or employed by a German agent at the time the fire started at his work bench becomes a decisive question in this case. Its importance appears from the statement in the Commission's original decision that, in view of the background established in the sabotage cases which showed authorized sabotage activities in the United States by an organized group of German agents, " inferences against Germany were rendered easier than they otherwise would be ", which means, in application to the present case, that if Wozniak is shown to have been a German agent at the time of the Kingsland fire, the Commission would be justified in inferring that Germany was responsible, under the Treaty of Berlin, for that fire unless such inference was prohibited by other evidence. The Commission's theory in the earlier decision that this fire was the result of an industrial accident precluded any such inference because in that situation it was immaterial whether or not Wozniak was a German agent, but, inasmuch as now the fire is no longer regarded as an industrial accident, the inference above indicated can be drawn if it be shown that Wozniak was a German agent. The national Commissioners are in agreement on this point, as stated in their certificate of disagreement. It is evident from the foregoing brief analysis of the situation that in examin- ing the new evidence we may proceed on the basis that Wozniak's testimony and the Johnson report are wholly discredited, and that the findings of the Commission based on that evidence may be disregarded. There is much new evidence now before the Commission which is intended to show that Wozniak was a German agent at the time of the Kingsland fire, not only by reason of new facts presented but also by giving a new meaning and value to some of the old evidence on that point which was discredited in the original decision. Some of the new facts presented to establish Wozniak's presence in Mexico in 1917 are embodied in the affidavits of Sylvester Golka (December 9, 1931)</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>125 and Peter Panas and his wife (November 14, 1931). Exhibits 929, 930-1, 930-2. Golka and Panas and his wife were old friends of Wozniak, and were on intimate terms with him in 1917. They are highly reputable and trustworthy people. They set forth in their affidavits, with some convincing detail, the receipt by them of three letters in all, written by Wozniak to them from Mexico in the Summer of 1917. The only ground on which it has been sought to discredit their receipt of these letters is that in the letter to Golka he requested that it be destroyed upon receipt, which was done, and that later he followed up the letters to Panas and destroyed them himself. It is argued that it was wholly inconsistent that he should be so anxious to have those letters destroyed and at the same time should have made no such request in his letters written contemporaneously to Baran, especially in view of the fact that the Golka and Panas letters were clearly innocent in character, whereas the Baran letters were distinctly incriminating, taken in connection with other facts in the record. This argument obviously is based on a false premise, because having admitted that the Baran letters are forgeries, they cannot be accepted as a basis for discrediting this other evidence. Naturally they did not contain a request that they be destroyed because that would have been inconsistent with the purpose for which they were forged, which was to be produced in this case to prove that Wozniak was in Mexico in 1917. There is nothing in the record which throws any discredit upon these Golka and Panas affidavits, and there is no reason why they should not be believed. They stand, therefore, as credible evidence that Wozniak was in Mexico in 1917, and his desire to have his letters destroyed shows that he wished to conceal his presence in Mexico at the time they were written. It will be noted that by these spurious letters fabricated by Wozniak, he in effect represents himself to have been in Mexico in 1917, and makes himself out a perjurer when he swore to the contrary in his previous testimony. An item in the new evidence, which gives new meaning and value to some of the old evidence, is the report of the police official in Poland. Exhibit No. 936. This report is to the effect that in the neighborhood of Wozniak's old home in Rawa Russka there was a forest in which Wozniak once worked, known as the " Karow " forest, and that it was customary in Poland to add to the family name a second name either as a prefix or suffix, descriptive of the person's occupation or place of residence. He says, accordingly, that Wozniak, as a workman in this forest, would have been known as Karowsky-Wozniak, or Wozniak-Karowsky perhaps the added name might have been Karifsky instead of Karowsky. This, however, is an unimportant detail. The old evidence, to which this new evidence gives new value, is found in the affidavits of several witnesses who identified Wozniak as a man known as Karowsky, or Karnowsky, or a phonetically similar name, in the Summer of 1917, as an associate of admitted German agents in Mexico. In its original decision the Commission mistrusted this attempted identification largely because there was at that time nothing in the record to show that Wozniak had ever used such a name as Karowsky. In view of this new evidence, however, the name sounding like " Karowsky " no longer appears out of a clear sky and without any connection with Wozniak. Consequently, the earlier affidavits, identifying Wozniak as the man known by such a name, who was the associate of German agents in Mexico, are entitled to be regarded as seriously important evidence. Furthermore, the explanation about Wozniak's earlier occupation as a lumberman in the Karow forest has the further value, in connection with his Tupper Lake story, of showing that even if he had never been to Tupper Lake, he knew enough about the life and work in a lumber camp to enable him to</p>
<p>126</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERM ANY</h3>
<p>invent the rather meager details which he gives in his affidavit about his life there. The information in his affidavit about the wages and terms of employ- ment, and the distance of the camp from the railroad station, and the name of the camp, could have been obtained without going to the camp at all. Most of it was obtainable from the Lumber Company's employment agency in New York, and would be contained in the usual employment application form supplied to applicants. With this information, supplemented by his early experiences in lumber camps, he was clever enough, as a fabricator, to make an affidavit sufficiently accurate in detail to persuade the American Agent that, as he conceded in oral argument, it was certainly possible that Wozniak had been at Tupper Lake at some time before his trip there as a witness in 1929. Wozniak's status as a German agent is further supported by new evidence in the affidavits of the witnesses Capitula (Exh. No. 902), Nolan (Exh. No. 890), King (Exh. No. 891), Palmer (Exh. No. 896 (a) ). and Clucas (Exh. Nos. 822 and 895). This testimony leaves much to be desired, but, if Wozniak's own testimony in conflict with it be disregarded for the reasons above stated, it stands undisputed, and, taken together with the above mentioned Golka and Panas affidavits and the earlier affidavits identifying Wozniak as the German agent known as Karowsky in Mexico in 1917, a prima facie case, at least, has been made establishing that Wozniak actually was a German agent at the time of the Kingsland fire. With Wozniak's status as a German agent established, it is not necessary to prove that he purposely or actually started the fire, because, for the reasons already stated, the Commission, in these circumstances, is justified in drawing the inference that Wozniak was responsible for it, even though proof is lacking as to exactly how it was done. It may be noted on this point, however, that the Commission is not bound to accept either Wozniak's statement of how it was started or Herrmann's explanation of what his instructions to Wozniak were about the use of incendi- ary pencils, because in the present view of the value of the testimony of these witnesses, the Commission is at liberty to disregard everything they have said on this subject, and, so far as the record shows, the real truth as to how this fire was started has never been disclosed. We do know, however, from thoroughly dependable testimony, that, as found in our original decision, the Imperial German Government had author- ized the destruction of ammunition plants in the United States during the period of our neutrality, and that an organization of German sabotage agents had been established for that purpose and had been supplied with funds and imple- ments to be used in sabotage activities. We also know, as a settled fact in this case, that the Kingsland fire started at Wozniak's work bench, and we now find that a prima facie case has been made against Wozniak as a German agent himself at that time. The purpose, the opportunity, the means, and the agent were all there. In view of these considerations and conclusions, the Commission is justified in holding that on the record, as it stands, the German Government must be held responsible, under the terms of the Treaty of Berlin, for the damages resulting to the claimants by reason of the Kingsland fire. Chandler P. ANDERSON Note: The so-called Herrmann secret message, embodied in the Blue Book Magazine for January, 1917 (Exhibit No. 904), if accepted as authentic, would conclusively prove the liability of Germany in both the Kingsland and the Black Tom cases. Inasmuch, however, as the authenticity of that message is questioned, no reference has been made to it in reaching the conclusions</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>127 stated in the foregoing opinion, which demonstrates that Germany should be held liable in the Kingsland case independently of that evidence, and even if its authenticity should not be accepted. As appears from the Certificate of Disagreement by the National Commis- sioners referring both of these cases to the Umpire for decision, the American Commissioner disagreed in the Black Tom case as well as in the Kingsland case.</p>

<p>should be granted the function of the Commission would be to reconsider upon the original record, or upon that record as it might now be supplemented, the question of the measure of damages to which the claimant is entitled. But if there has been an accord and satisfaction, as asserted in the petition, this could not be done. Upon the theory of accord and satisfaction the petitioner would be entitled to a judgment for $160,000 but the Commission is, as I understand it, without the authority of a court to enforce agreements made between the diplomatic representatives of the two governments. Thus, if a new cause of action is asserted, based upon an agreement between the diplomatic representatives of the two governments, I think the Commission is entirely without authority to enter a decree based thereon. It can act only upon the agreements of the national agents accredited to represent the respective nations before it. On the other hand, if the matters now alleged are put forward as an additional basis in equity for the reopening of the former order of the Commission I find myself at a loss to know why, between March 1933 and July 1934 they were not placed in the record, for, during that entire period, it was open to the petitioner to supplement her pleading and to permit Germany to answer on the pleading so supplemented instead of answering only the original petition alleging other grounds foi relief. In either view, therefore, I think the Commission cannot consider the petition now under review and that it must be dismissed. Done at Washington, D.C., January 29, 1936. Owen J. ROBERTS Umpire</p>

<p>FRAUD. Held (1) that Commission has all attributes and functions of a continuing tribunal until close of work, and as such tries and adjudicates large number of separate and individual cases : word " amount " (singular) in preamble of Agreement of August 10, 1922, does not make Commission a tribunal to try a single action divided into counts (related provisions, Commission's practice, Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928); but that Commission is not therefore precluded from reopening case after decision: Agreement, not denning term " decision " used in art. VI (providing that decisions of Commission are final and binding), leaves it to Commission to determine when decision, whether executed or not, is " final "; and (2) that Commission (a) must grant request for reopening and correct decision when decision does not comport with record or involves material error of law: see Com- mission's practice, no need for agreement between Agents (powers otherwise absent could only be conferred upon Commission by formal agreement of two governments amending Agreement) ; and (b) may not reopen for presentation of " after-discovered " evidence: justification under municipal law (power of Court to close proofs and compel final submission of case) does not prevail before Commission (no closing without consent or over objection), while failure earlier to enact now existing legislation permitting American Government to summon witnesses etc. (Act of June 7, 1933) provides no excuse; but (c), still sitting as a Court, as every other tribunal has inherent power to reopen and to revise decisions induced by fraud.

Certificate of Disagreement1 The American Agent, pursuant to instructions from the Government of the United States, has requested the Commission to render a decision on the question of its jurisdiction to reconsider its decisions in the so-called sabotage claims, which question the Government and the Agent of the United States consider is one to be decided by the Commission itself. The question is raised by the pending petition presented to the Commission by the Government of the United States, through the American Agent, on May 4, 1933, on behalf of the claimants in the so-called sabotage cases, Docket Nos. 8103, 8117, et al. In support of this petition the American Agent has presented, and is con- tinuing to present, the testimony of a number of witnesses, taken under the authority of and in accordance with an Act of Congress approved June 7, 1933, and certain other evidence, and may desire to present some additional 1 See Appendix for Minutes of the meeting of Commission of October 31, 1933 (pp. 1597-1612), outlining the action taken with respect to the Certificate of Disagreement dated October 31, 1933, signed only by the American Commissioner.

<p>evidence not yet available, if the Commission's right to reconsider these cases is upheld by the decision of the Umpire. The national Commissioners are in disagreement on the questions thus raised, and have rendered their respective opinions setting forth the grounds of their disagreement. The opinion of the American Commissioner is that, under the terms of the Agreement of August 10, 1922, between the two Governments, establishing the Commission, the Commission inherently has the juridical right to determine for itself its jurisdiction to entertain petitions for rehearing. The American Commissioner is further of the opinion that the Commission has in general the right in its discretion to reconsider a decision rendered by it, and that in the sabotage cases, inasmuch as the last decision of the Commission in those cases was made by the Umpire on a Certificate of Disagreement by the national Commissioners, the Umpire can continue to act for the Commission in dealing with this jurisdictional question as well as with all other questions arising under the pending petition in those cases. The German Commissioner disagrees with the American Commissioner on all of the points above mentioned, and holds that the Commission has no jurisdictional right to reconsider a decision once made, unless both Govern- ments consent. The written opinions of the National Commissioners, which have been submitted by them to the Umpire, showing the points and grounds of dis- agreement between them, are as follows: Opinion of the American Commissioner on the Question of Revision of Decisions The Agreement of August 10, 1922, between the United States and Germany under which this Commission was established, recites in its preamble that the two Governments " being desirous of determining the amount to be paid by Germany in satisfaction of Germany's financial obligations under the Treaty concluded by the two Governments on August 25, 1921, [Treaty of Berlin] * * * have resolved to submit the questions for decision to a mixed commission ", etc. The Agreement further provides, in Article I, that the commission shall pass upon specified categories of claims. The commission is to consist, as provided in Article II, of two national commissioners, one appointed by each Government, and an umpire selected by both Governments, but eventually, by request of the German Government, appointed by the President of the United States. The umpire was authorized " to decide upon any cases concerning which the commissioners may disagree, or upon any points of difference that may arise in the course of their proceedings ". The Agreement also provides, in Article VI, that " The commission shall receive and consider all written statements or documents which may be presen- ted to it by or on behalf of the respective Governments ", and that " The deci- sions of the commission and those of the umpire (in case there may be any) shall be accepted as final and binding upon the two Governments ". There are no other provisions in the Agreement which have any bearing on the question under consideration. No specific provision is made in the Agree- ment for reconsidering or correcting any decisions rendered by the Commission. Whatever authority the Commission may have to reconsider and revise its decisions must be derived from the provisions above mentioned, taken in connection with the general powers discussed herein elsewhere, which were conferred on this Commission by the Agreement. During the course of the proceedings of the Commission many occasions have arisen for taking action on correcting awards and reconsidering decisions.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>163 Although no specific decision in any case where the point was at issue has been made by the Commission on the question of its authority to take such action as a matter of principle, the Commission, in practice, has adopted a course of procedure which demonstrates that in its opinion it had discretionary power to reconsider and revise its decisions to fulfill the purposes for which it was organ- ized and to serve the ends of justice. It has always assumed, and acted on that assumption, that it was fully empowered to correct any clerical or pro forma errors in its decisions or awards, and this has been done as a matter of routine procedure. It has also assumed, and acted on that assumption, that on any application for reopening and revising a decision on the merits the Commission should receive and consider any evidence offered in support of such application, reserving for decision, after the examination of such evidence, the question of whether or not the Commission, in its discretion, should grant the application based thereon. The procedure adopted by the Commission, in dealing with such applications, has been, to recite, in the first place, the receipt of the appli- cation and the additional evidence offered in support of it, and then to state, in substantially the following form, that — Although the rules of this Commission, conforming to the practice of inter- national commissions, make no provision for a rehearing in any case in which a final decree has been made, nevertheless, the application and evidence sub- mitted in support thereof have been carefully considered by the Commission. It so happens that hitherto in all the cases, in which rehearing petitions have been filed, except those in which the two Agents agreed to a reopening, as hereinafter mentioned, the Commission has found that the grounds upon which they rested did not warrant reopening the case, or amending the terms of the decision, and the application in all such cases has been dismissed on that ground. The first case in which this question was presented was decided by the Umpire on August 31, 1926. In that decision the procedure above stated was adopted, and has thereafter invariably been followed both by the Umpire and by the national Commissioners in dealing with similar cases. It seems clear that if the Commission had been of the opinion that under no circumstances was it at liberty or empowered to reopen and reconsider a decision already made it would not have entertained, even tentatively, a petition for reconsideration, but would have dismissed it as a matter of course without examining or considering the grounds upon which it was made. No question or objection to this mode of procedure was ever raised by either Agent until the question of reconsidering the Commission's decision in the so-called sabotage cases arose in January, 1931. The German Agent, in oppo- sition to the American Agent's petition for a rehearing in those cases on newly- discovered evidence, objected on the jurisdictional ground that the Commission was without authority to admit the further evidence then offered, or to grant a rehearing on the basis of such evidence or any other evidence, after the claims had been dismissed by the Commission. The German Agent based his objection primarily on the ground that under the Agreement establishing the Commission it had no inherent jurisdictional powers which would justify a revision of a decison once made, and that, apart from any question of inherent powers, the Commission's jurisdiction on this point was restricted by the above-quoted provision of Article VI that " The decisions of the commission and those of the umpire (in case there may be any) shall be accepted as final and binding upon the two Governments ". He also asserted, in support of his contention, that in all cases in which any revisions or corrections of decisions had been made this action had been taken</p>
<p>164</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>with the consent of both Agents, acting for their respective Governments, and, therefore, did not contravene his contention. The American Agent, on the other hand, contended that, considering the purpose for which the Commission was established and the character of the duties imposed upon it, all authority necessary or appropriate to carry out its work must be regarded as having been conferred upon it. On this basis, he insisted that, inasmuch as the fundamental purpose of its creation was, as recited in the preamble to the Agreement, to determine " the amount to be paid by Germany in satisfaction of Germany's financial obligations " under the Treaty of Berlin, the individual and separate claims were each a part of Germany's entire financial obligation to be determined by the Commission, and until the total obligation was established no award or decision as to the component items could be regarded as final, but meanwhile was always subject to revision. * The American Agent also contended that the Commission had inherent power to organize its work and procedure in any appropriate way which seemed to it advisable for the purpose of aiding in efficiently and expeditiously performing its duties, and that unless the Commission had rendered decisions as rapidly as they could agree on them it would have been utterly impossible to make any headway in dealing with the gigantic task of disposing of 20,000 claims. Nevertheless, in adopting this plan of procedure, the Commission necessarily had to hold in reserve the right to reconsider and revise any decision which, as the Commission proceeded through the mass of claims, seemed to be inconsistent with information later acquired or with more mature views later adopted in other cases. He, therefore, concluded that no decision was unalterably final until the work of the Commission was finally completed. It so happened that before this issue arose the Commission had undertaken to lay down a series of rules for the guidance of the Agents on its attitude in regard to accepting new evidence as a basis for reconsidering decisions. These rules were set out in the Commission's decision dismissing a petition for rehearing in the case of the Philadelphia-Girard National Bank claim (Com- mission's Decisions, page 939). a Only two of these rules have any bearing on the present question, and they were: " Where it appears that manifestly the Commission committed an error in its findings of fact on the evidence produced by the Agents at the time the claim was submitted for decision, or in applying the principles of law and the rules of the Commission as established and applied in its previous decisions, the Commission will take under consideration the question of reopening or changing the award. " On the other hand where a rehearing is demanded merely on the ground that by reason of newly submitted evidence the underlying facts were different I The decision of the Commission as announced by the Umpire with the concur- rence of both national Commissioners in The Lusitania Cases said (printed Decisions and Opinions, page 30) : " The United States is in effect making one demand against Germany on some 12,500 counts. That demand is for compensation and reparation for certain losses sustained by the United States and its nationals. While in determining the amount which Germany is to pay each claim must be considered separately, no one of them can be disposed of as an isolated claim or suit but must be considered in relation to all others presented in this one demand. In all of the claims the parties are the same. They must all be determined and disposed of under the same Treaty and by the same tribunal. * * * " (Note by the Secretariat, Vol. V I I , p . 42.)

<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>165 from those appearing in the record as submitted at the time of the decision, the Commission will not grant a reopening or a reconsideration of the award." This decision, in which these rules were announced, was dated April 21, 1930, and at that time the Commission thought it had practically finished its work, and this set of rules was intended to serve as an aid to the Agents in bringing the work of the Commission to a conclusion by discouraging petitions for rehearings, rather than as an administrative decision dealing with a juris- dictional question. This question had not, at that time, been presented and argued by the Agents, nor had the Commission had occasion to pass upon it in any submitted claim. This situation accounts for the rather incidental way in which these rules were announced. As the decision itself shows, the rules stated therein did not control or influence the conclusions reached by the Commission in dismissing the petition in that case. Accordingly, they did not have the authority of a decision by the Commission on an issue argued and submitted by the Agents, and did not establish a precedent which the Com- missioners would have felt called upon to follow in latter cases if they had applied it in the decision of an earlier case. At this point it will be convenient to examine the principle on which these rules rested and some of the implications arising from them. Basically they assume an authority on the part of the Commission to deter- mine, in its discretion, whether or not it will reconsider a decision, which implies jurisdictional power in the Commission to do so. if in its judgment that should be done. That consideration would seem to establish that in the opinion of the Commission, at least, it had jurisdictional power to reconsider its earlier decisions. In further support of that view, it will be noted that the rule against recon- sideration deals only with cases where the " rehearing is demanded merely on the ground " that the newly-submitted evidence changes the underlying facts on which the decision was made. Nothing is said by the Commission about what its attitude would be if the new evidence disclosed misrepresentation or fraud as to the facts, or the suppression of material evidence. No case presenting such considerations was under consideration by the Commission at that time, and it did not have such a situation in mind in announcing that rule, which applied more particularly to the consequences arising from delay or neglect on the part of the claimants in presenting their claim, rather than to the more serious question which would arise under the other circumstances above suggested. By announcing that rule the Commission certainly did not intend to preclude itself from taking different action if a different set of cir- cumstances demanded different treatment in the interest of justice and equity, or if the Commission had been imposed upon. The implication of those rules was not that the Commission was without authority to reconsider, but that there were certain circumstances in which it might exercise its authority, and other cases in which it would not be disposed to exercise that authority, which clearly indicated that, in its opinion, the exer- ciseof that authority rested in the discretion of the Commission. It may also be noted, in passing, that those rules did not apply to the so-called " late claims " submitted to the Commission by the Agreement of December 31, 1928, between the two Governments. This is shown by the statement introducing those rules in the decision, that they had " general application to petitions and requests for rehearings as to the claims originally listed ". This exclusion of" late claims " from the application of those rules calls attention to a significant difference between the jurisdiction of the Commission under the earlier Agreement and under the later Agreement. 12</p>
<p>166</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>Under the later Agreement the Governments expressly stipulated that " late claims " must be presented to the Commission " with the supporting evidence within six calendar months from the first day of February, 1929 ". The Commission ruled that this provision precluded it from receiving any supporting evidence for any purpose after the period thus fixed. Under the earlier Agreement of August 10, 1922, which applied to the sabotage claims, no time limit was set for the presentation of evidence or the final submission of claims to the Commission for decision. It merely provided, in Article VI, that " The commission shall receive and consider all written statements or documents which may be presented ", etc. In applying this provision, the Commission ruled that it was not at liberty to fix a time limit within which a claim must be submitted, and could not refuse to receive new documents or written statements offered by either side even after a claim had been formally submitted for decision. Under the authority of this provision, such new evidence was actually received by the Commission on application by the German Agent after the first oral argument and submission of" the sabotage cases at the session in Washington in April, 1929. It must be observed, however, that this ruling did not deal with the question of the introduction of new evidence after the Commission had actually rendered a decision, which question, as herein elsewhere stated, was always reserved for special consideration. The chief significance of this difference in the two Agreements is that it shows that when the Government desired to place a limitation on the juris- diction of the Commission they put it in the Agreement. At the time those rules were announced there was no case pending to which they applied, and neither Agent discussed them with the Commission. Later on, after the rehearing petitions in the sabotage cases came up in January, 1931, both Agents argued about those rules at some length, seeking to interpret them in support of their respective contentions. The Commission, desiring to determine this question on a basis of principle, rather than on an interpretation of those rules so casually announced, addressed a letter to the Agents, under date of March 30, 1931, indicating that, whatever purpose those rules were intended to serve at the time they were announced, they were " not irrevocable " and should be disregarded in discussing the question of revision then under consideration. 1 They added, " it is desirable that argu- ment addressed to the question should be devoted not to the interpretation of that language but to the principle itself". Subsequently, at the session held by the Commission in Boston in July- August, 1931, to consider the reopening petition in the sabotage cases, the Commission permitted the submission, provisionally, of a quantity of new evidence, and heard extensive oral argument of both sides on the question of the merits of the claims as well as on the question of jurisdiction to reopen. No decision on this question was announced by the Commission at that time, and since that hearing the Commission has not only received, but has expressly invited the submission of, new evidence in the sabotage claims, produced at considerable expense by both sides, and at a session in Washington in Novem- ber, 1932, heard oral argument on the issues presented, involving not only the jurisdictional question of its right to reconsider the original decision but also the merits of the claims as affected by the new evidence. 1 On this point attention is called to the fact that the Rules as originally adopted on November 15, 1922, contained at the end of Rule VIII the provision that " The decisions in writing ( 1 ) of the two Commissioners, where they are in agreemen t, otherwise (2) of the Umpire, shall be final ", but this Rule was revised on February 14, 1924, and this provision was stricken out.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>167 Throughout the proceedings of the Commission, while the question of reconsidering its decision in the sabotage cases was pending, the Commission carefully refrained from any formal announcement of its opinion on the juris- dictional question. The German Agent's position was noted in the record, and the proceedings of the Commission were explicitly stated to be without prejudice on this question, which was specifically reserved for decision at the close of the proceedings. The foregoing is a full and impartial exposition of the attitude and record of the Commission on the question of its jurisdictional power to reconsider a decision, as the record stood, down to the time of the argument and the sub- mission of that question to the Commission at its session in Washington in November, 1932. In the argument at that Washington session both Agents again discussed this jurisdictional question, and the Umpire, in the course of the argument (transcript, page 787 [printed, transcript, page 244]), clarified that issue in the following dialogue with the German Agent: " THE UMPIRE. What I understood and what we all understood the German Agent to suggest was that he presents to this Commission the proposition that its construction of the treaty should be that it has no power now to rehear this case. I did not understand him to take the position that the Commission could not consider the question of its own jurisdiction. If he desires to clear that question, he may do so. " THE GERMAN AGENT. The understanding of the Commission is entirely correct. " THE UMPIRE. In other words, that is a justiciable question here. " THE GERMAN AGENT. Yes." The American Agent agreed with the German Agent on this point. Ac- cordingly, the Commission had an authoritative statement from the official representatives of both Governments that the question of the power of the Commission to receive new evidence and reconsider a decision already rendered was a justiciable question, the decision of which was within the jurisdiction of the Commission. It will be recalled that the Agreement establishing this Commission was made between the Executive branches of the two Governments, and did not have the status of a treaty. It could, therefore, be interpreted or amended by similar agreements between the Executive branch of the Governments, and it was thac branch of their respective Governments for which the two Agents were the spokesmen in stating their understanding of the jurisdiction of the Commission to determine its own jurisdiction on this point. The German Commissioner apparently disagreed with his Government on this point, as appears from his reservation of it from submission to the Umpire in the national Commissioners' certificate of disagreement. He there stated that " the German Commissioner takes the position that the question of the jurisdiction of the Commission to re-examine any case after a final decision has been rendered is not a proper question to be certified to the Umpire on disagreement of the National Commissioners and reserves that question from this certificate ". Just what the German Commissioner meant by this reservation is not clear, and is subject to explanation, but, in the opinion of the American Commissioner, neither of the national Commissioners has the authority to overrule or disregard an agreement made by the two Governments as to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and the two Governments certainly have agreed in this point, as evidenced by the above-quoted statement of the German Agent in oral argument, concurred in by the American Agent.</p>
<p>168</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>There is one more point to be noted in support of the position that the Commission has the right to reconsider a decision as a matter of jurisdictional authority. This point arises from the fact that there is no provision in the Agreement of August 10, 1922, which limits or prohibits that right. The Commission was established by that Agreement without limitation or condition as to its authority to carry out the duties assigned to it, except the conditions which were embodied in the provisions quoted at the outset of this discussion. In none of those provisions will be found any condition or even a suggestion that the method and procedure, or the basis of judgment, to be adopted by the Commission in performing its duties did not rest wholly in its own discretion. It is true that the German Agent contends, as above indicated, that the stipula- tion in the Agreement as to the finality of the Commission's decisions precludes the reconsideration by the Commission of any decision rendered by it. In the opinion of the American Commissioner this stipulation is addressed to the two Governments, rather than to the Commission, and applies only to decisions which the Commission itself, after the exercise of its judicial and discretionary powers, regards as no longer subject to revision, or by reason of its final termi- nation is no longer in a position to deal with. ' On the other hand, the rules adopted by the Commission pertain to remedies, rather than rights, and were addressed by the Commission to the Agents and claimants as an expression of its attitude on matters wholly within its juris- dictional powers.2 As showing the wide discretionary powers conferred upon the Commission, it will be noted that the members of the Commission were not required to take an oath of office, as usually is exacted in international arbitrations, that they would render their decisions in accordance with the principles of international law, or justice, or equity. It is true that treaty interpretation, rather than international law, ruled the greater part of the decisions of the Commission on the claims submitted, but the fact remains that the Commissioners were entrusted with the interpretation of the Treaty without any limitations whatso- ever, and treaty interpretation involves many important questions of inter- national law. The two Governments recognized that the Commission must necessarily be a law unto itself in this unexplored area, and relied wholly on the sound judgment and sense of justice of the Commissioners in establishing what might be called the " law of the Commission ". In this respect the Commission is unique among international claims com- missions, and, for that reason, must be regarded as standing in a class by itself. Arguments as to its powers drawn from the proceedings of other claims com- missions differently conditioned and organized are of no value here, and those advanced by the Agent of Germany based on precedents found in the procedure of other commissions, accordingly, do not require consideration. 1 See footnote 5. a As said in Administrative Decision No. V (printed Decisions and Opinions, pages 186-187): " * * * The American nationals who acquired rights under this Treaty are without a remedy to enforce them save through the United States. As a part of the means of supplying that remedy this Commission was by Agreement created as the forum for determining the amount of Germany's obligations under the Treaty. That Agreement neither added to nor subtracted from the rights or the obligations fixed by the Treaty but clothed this Commission with jurisdiction over all claims based on such rights and obligations. The Treaty does not attempt to deal with rules of procedure or of practice or with the forum for determining or the remedy to be pursued in enforcing the rights and obligations arising therunder. * * * " (Note by the Secretariat, Vol. VII, p. 149.)</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>169 The American Commissioner finds, accordingly, that the Commission has, and was intended by the two Governments to have, extraordinary and extensive powers far beyond those specifically mentioned in the Agreement establishing it. These extraordinary powers are inherent in the entity thus established, and comprise any and all authority necessary and appropriate for carrying out its duties, and the Commission may determine in its own discretion the extent of these powers and how they shall be exercised, subject always to whatever limitation or control the two Governments may impose by joint agreement between themselves. As yet, the two Governments have not agreed to any limitation of the Com- mission's power to reconsider decisions, but, on the contrary, have, through their official representatives before the Commission, affirmed that this question is a "justiciable question " within the jurisdiction of the Commission to deter- mine for itself. In other words, it rests in the discretion of the Commission to decide whether or not any decision should be reconsidered on new evidence or argument submitted on a petition for rehearing, or on its own motion if it finds that it has been imposed upon. The American Government has already expressed its opinion on this point through Secretary of State Stimson, who stated, in a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury dated February 16, 1933, " In my opinion, it is solely within the competency of the Commission to decide as to the reopening of cases which have been heard and adjudicated by it." In conclusion, the American Commissioner is of the opinion that the rules announced in the Philadelphia-Girard National Bank case decision do not apply to the question under consideration, and also that, as already stated by the Commission, they, like any other rules adopted by the Commission, were subject to revision and were not irrevocable. Furthermore, it should be made clear that the Commission will consider new evidence in support of a rehearing petition showing misrepresentation or fraud as to the facts or the suppression of material evidence, or that the Commission has otherwise been imposed upon, or that new evidence not previously available has been discov- ered which would justify a different decision. In such cases the Commission has the power, and will exercise it in its discretion, to reconsider a previous decision. This right to reconsider should be applied only to a limited and special class of cases. It may be noted, however, that the Commission, by its previous careful and well-considered action in dealing with matters entrusted to its discretion in these proceedings, has abundantly demonstrated that it will not abuse its discretionary powers in dealing with reopening petitions. It will be recalled that it has not as yet granted any such petition. It may also be noted that the American Agent has effectively cooperated with the Commission in its efforts to complete the work of the Commission as promptly as possible, by refusing, on his own responsibility, to present several hundred applications for rehearings which he considered were not well-founded. The Commission cannot announce in advange any general rule as to how this right will be exercised because that would depend in each case on whether or not the facts presented satisfied the Commission that in its discretion the right should be exercised. This procedure is consistent with the course hitherto followed by the Com- mission in dealing with rehearing petitions. Any other course would amount to criticism and repudiation of its previous action. Unless the Commission had the right to reconsider a decision, it was absolutely without justification for hearing two extensive and very expensive re-arguments in the sabotage cases, which have prolonged the life of the Commission for upwards of two</p>

<p>years, at considerable expense to both Governments and, incidentally, great additional expense to the American claimants in procuring the new evidence submitted. In the opinion of the American Commissioner the Commission would not, and should not, have adopted that course unless the Commission believed it is authorized to revise its decision in these cases if the new evidence and arguments presented justified that action. Chandler P. ANDERSON American Commissioner Washington, June 21, 1933. Opinion of the German Commissioner on the Question of Reopening The question whether this Commission has the power to reopen a case has fully and thoroughly been dealt with by the two Agents in some of their briefs in the so-called sabotage cases and in the oral argument held in Boston July 30, August 1, 1931. After carefully having examined the arguments proffered from both sides I wish to state my opinion as follows: In dealing with the issue now before the Commission it must be kept in mind, that this Commission is an International Commission, an International Court. Therefore as to its rules undoubtedly no principles specifically American apply. Even if from reasons unknown to me every court in the United States — Federal as well as State Court — would be considered as having the " inherent power " to reopen a case, such power would have no bearing whatever on the question whether an international Court would have the same right. There is no doubt that in Europe at least no continental Court of the leading nations and certainly no Court in Germany has such power except when and where it is transferred to it by a special legislative act or provision. But even as to the power said to be " inherent " in the courts of the United States, the convincing force of the argument offered by the American Agent is strangely weakened by an instance so much relied upon by himself: the instance has been taken from the law of California and the Report by the Law Enforcement Commission. The reason that in the wellknown Mooney and Billing case the Californian Court declined a petition for reopening and that said Commission took exception to this result, was not because the Commission thought the Court had violated the law by denying its right to reopen, but because it thought the legislation of the State California should have provided for a law transferring such power to the court. Hardly a better illustration of the nature of the American Agent's error can be found: the right to reopen is not a power inherent in the court, but a power inherent in the sovereignty of a State to establish such right and to authorise a court to do so under the conditions and modalities the sovereign thinks fit. Without such authorization no court neither in the United States nor anywheie else has a right to reopen. And no international court can claim such right but by the authority from those powers which called it into life. Here again the American Agent erred when from the fact that some of the Mixed Tribunals created by the Treaty of Versailles have provisions dealing with a possibility to reopen he concluded that such power must have been inherent in those courts, and he committed a further error when he reached the conclusion that therefore such power was also vested in this Commission. The German Agent has already pointed out, that those tribunals had especially transferred to them the power to make their own rules by the Treaty of</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>1 7 1 Versailles and that under the authority of the power thus transferred the court by unanimous decision adopted such rules which thereupon were approved by the Powers concerned and published in the official Journals destined to promulgate the legislative acts of said Powers. Moreover the instances as cited by the American Agent show that the courts considered it necessary to make a special provision in order to establish the right of reopening and that f.i. the Anglo-German Tribunal, making such provision in the year 1925, was far from making it retroactive, thus clearly showing that it did not consider such right to reopen as an inherent right applicable therefore to all cases brought before it, but as a right which could only be brought into effect by a specific provision (under the authority of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles) and which therefore could be applied only to cases not yet decided by the tribunal and therefore not being " res judicatae ". Moreover a more thorough examination of the nature of the alleged " inherent power " of a court and especially of this Commission will show that the question so generally formulated and so broadly dealt with by the American Agent comprises a rather considerable number of " sub-ques- tions " — which it will be necessary to examine separately. I. The theory of an " inherent power " of a court to reopen a case is not borne out by the instances offered by the American Agent even as far as American domestic courts are concerned. As already pointed out, courts are created. Created by an act of legislation, deriving their authority from the sovereign power of a nation, represented in a written or unwritten constitution. Thus it is a derivative power exclusively depending on the volition and intention of its sovereign. To show that a court has a certain power means therefore the obligation to show that such power was transferred to it (thus f.i. power and scope of its jurisdiction etc.). Such transfer could be made either by the act creating the courts, transferring thereby a specific right to a court as such or by a special act of legislation. In either case it needs a specific provision. Therefore it would need a clear and unambiguous proof that a right, as f.i. a right to reopen, had been trans- ferred to it. But this is exactly the opposite to what the American Agent considers to be an " inherent " power of a court. Obviously the legislative policy as to the scope of the powers to be transferred to a court will vary in several nations and actually differ very much. No reason whatever therefore exists to conclude from the fact that one state provides by its legislation for a reopening measure, that therefore other nations did the same. Moreover even if two nations should have made similar provisions in that regard for their domestic courts that would never justify the conclusion that therefore an international court created by those two nations must necessarily have the same power. Here again it needs a specific creative act, to wit the clear and unambiguous volition and intention of the two sovereign Powers concerned to vest in an international court created by them such power. No argument is necessary to state that in the Agreement of August 1922 no provision exists authorising the Commission to reopen a case. Yet the Agree- ment of August 1922 is the only charter of this Commission as to its rights to proceed. The right to reopen is therefore not transferred upon this Commission. (This does not mean that the Commission or the two national Commissioners might not unanimously agree to correct a decision, as I will discuss under No. 7.)</p>

<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1933-2"><span class="para-num">2.</span><p>But even if the authority to reopen would have been transferred to the Commission it still would be within the volition of the Commission whether it would be willing to use such authority or not. In that case the Commission had to say so, which means that it had to make the right to reopen a specific part of its rules. But no such provision has been made. Instead the Commission has already and unambiguously expressed its will to the contrary. It has done so in its decision on the Petition to Reconsider an Award in the case United States of America on behalf of Philadelphia-Girard National Bank, Claimant v. Germany and Direktion der Diskonto-Gesellschaft, Implea- ded. Docket No. 7531, List No. 2729. The Decision reads as follows: " In this case a final award was entered by the Commission on April 3, 1929. A Petition for the Reconsideration of this award, signed by the claimant and presented through its attorneys to the American Agent, has been submitted to the Commission together with certain additional evidence and a printed Memo- randum in support thereof, dated August 7, 1929, and prepared by the private counsel for the claimant. " Although the rules of this Commission, conforming to the practice of international Commissions, make no provision for a rehearing in any case in which a final decree has been made, this Petition and the supporting Memorandum and evidence have been carefully considered by the Commission. " Before taking up the questions raised by this Petition, the Commission desires to announce certain principles having general application to petitions and re- quests for rehearings as to the claims originally listed, by which the Commission will be guided in dealing with this and other similar applications. " Where it appears that manifestly the Commission committed an error in its findings of fact on the evidence produced by the Agents at the time the claim was submitted for decision, or in applying the principles of law and the rules of the Com- mission as established and applied in its previous decisions, the Commission will take under consideration the question of reopening or changing the award. " On the other hand, where a rehearing is demanded merely on the ground that by reason of newly submitted evidence the underlying facts were different from those appearing in the record as submitted at the time of the decision, the Com- mission will not grant a reopening or a reconsideration of the award. " The reconsideration of a claim after a final decision has been rendered would mean that the whole case would have to be dealt with anew. The new evidence submitted would have to be brought to the attention of the opposing party, which would have to be given a reasonable time to investigate and file additional or rebuttal evidence on its side, and also an amended answer or a reply, if that was found to be necessary, and then the whole case would have to be reexamined and decided again. All of these consequences would result from the failure or neglect of the moving party to produce the additional evidence before the claim was originally submitted for the decision of the Commission. " Moreover, if the production of new evidence by a party would give the right to have the whole case reopened, such right would necessarily attach not only to every claimant whose claim had been submitted and decided, but also to the respondent in each case as well. " If such a right were granted and exercised at this advanced stage of the pro- ceedings of the Commission, it would affect awards which have already been paid, and, apart from the confusion resulting from such procedure, it would be clearly contrary to the express wording and manifest purpose of the Agreement of August 10, 1922, between the United States and Germany. According to that Agreement the decisions of the Commission are accepted as final and binding upon both Governments, and, inasmuch as the governments are primarily the parties in interest, the private claimant, on whose behalf the Government of the United States has finally submitted a claim for decision, cannot be given the right to alter</p></div>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>173 or nullify this situation by producing new evidence changing the status of the claim as submitted and decided. " It is also pertinent to consider that most of the applications which have been made for rehearing have arisen in cases in which the Commission has pointed out wherein the claimant has failed to furnish evidence sufficient to establish the liability of Germany under the Treaty of Berlin, as interpreted by this Com- mission, and to grant a rehearing in those cases would mean a great injustice to the great majority of the claimants whose claims were dismissed by the Commission without indicating wherein the evidence submitted was insufficient, and, who, therefore, have been unable to discover new points of attack. It may also be noted that in no case, as yet, has the Commission granted an application to reopen a claim in which a final decision has been rendered. " The Commission will not consider questions of law, which have been settled in its earlier decisions, as to the jurisdiction of the Commission and the liability of Germany, under the Treaty of Berlin and the Agreements of August 10, 1922, and December 31, 1928, between the United States and Germany, as interpreted by this Commission. " The law of the Commission, as established in its earlier decisions, will con- trol the decisions of the Commission in all later cases." (All italics mine.) This decision plainly shows that the Commission had never the intention to apply a rule of reopening to its procedure.</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1933-3"><span class="para-num">3.</span><p>Moreover it shows that the whole question of reopening is res judicata; it has already been passed upon by the Commission and is " final and binding ".</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1933-4"><span class="para-num">4.</span><p>But even assuming for a moment and for argument's sake that the Com- mission had the power to reopen and were now willing to use it, yet it never would be authorized to make such rule retroactive. If there exist principles of a legal nature common to all or the larger part of civilized nations, they are that a law or a rule must be clearly expressed to make it applicable and that no law whatsoever shall be retroactive except when especially made so by the act creating said law. Now, here again it needs no argument, that this Commission has no power transferred upon it to make rules retroactive. Therefore even if this Commission had the power to provide for a reopening it could not reopen a case but after having made a special rule providing for such right and moreover it could not make such rule retroactive.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1933-5"><span class="para-num">5.</span><p>Thus the Commission would have no power to reopen, let alone a power to retroactively provide for a reopening even if the Agreement of August 10, 1922 would be silent as to the legal effect of the Commission's decisions. But the Agreement is far from such silence. Instead it expressly states in a formal and solemn way that " the decisions of the Commission shall be accepted as final and binding upon the two Governments " (italics mine). If language can be clear and unambiguous, this language is. Moreover we know that from the very beginning both Governments were anxious to expedite the Commission's work as much as possible. At the same time therefore, when they made the Agreement of August 10, 1922, they further agreed to limit the time for filing claims with the Commission to a rather short period thus clearly indicating what their conception of the Commission's task was.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1933-6"><span class="para-num">6.</span><p>As I tried to show, under the principles controlling the procedure of this Commission even an unanimous decision be it of the two Commissioners alone or be it of the two and the Umpire cannot establish a right to reopen. But assuming for argument's sake that the Commission by an unanimous vote would have the authority to provide for a rule to reopen a case, such authority would not meet the question, whether such rule could be established</p></div>
<p>174</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>by majority vote or — what comes to the same — by the Umpire alone if the two national Commissioners disagree. Theoretically the only possibility would be that under Article II of the Agreement the Umpire were called upon to decide the issue. But this would not only mean that the Umpire had to pass upon the principal question of the " inherent power " of the Commission as well as of its retro- active effect. Beyond that it would mean that assuming that on those two questions his findings would be in favor of the American Agent he had to pass on all cases reopened, whenever the national Commissioners disagree. Thus by the simple means of producing " new evidence " a case already decided by the national Commissioners could be brought before the Umpire. Now under the Agreement wherever the two national Commissioners agreed upon a decision the Umpire has no jurisdiction, and actually in innumerable and important cases the Commissioners have agreed on awards without the cooperation of the Umpire though in many cases from sound and good reasons he has been sitting with the Commissioners — if for no other reason, yet for the purpose of expediting the work and of avoiding in cases where the Commission ordered an oral argument, an unnecessary duplication of the argument should the national Commissioners disagree. Now under the American Agent's theory the right to reopen a case — or even to reopen a decision denying a reopening — is inherent in any case and numerous are the instances where he has attempted to exert this " right ". Consequently even in those cases in the decision of which the Umpire has not participated, the question whether a petition for reopening should be allowed would have to be decided by him wherever the two national Commissioners should disagree on that question. That would mean that the Umpire had to examine and consider the " new evidence " adduced or the argument made in support of a petition for reopening even in such cases wholly unknown to him (and those are by far the majority) in the adjudication of which he did not participate and in which he might differ from the findings of the two national Commissioners be it with regard to the legal or to the factual basis as presented at the time of the decision though such basis is also binding upon him under the provisions of the Agreement. From a logical point of view there is no reason why the Umpire if he has a right to consider a case on the ground of facts newly submitted should not have the same right on the ground of a legal argument newly presented. Thus he could change the Commission's rules. And he could even do so in cases where the Umpire acting at the time of the decision had concurred in such decision. Since in consequence of death the Umpire has changed several times during the work of the Commission and since the present Umpire has not taken office but after almost all cases had been decided, this would mean that a new man, wholly unfamiliar with the motifs and considerations which guided the former Umpire in joining the Commission's decisions would have to answer the question whether the so asserted " new evidence " be of such kind that if produced at a time prior to the decision it would have influenced and modified it. To point out these consequences is to prove the utter impossibility. Moreover such procedure would mean that in cases passed upon by both Commissioners — and therefore "final and binding " upon the two Governments — the case could be brought anew to a trial by the simple means of a petition of reopening, if such petition could be brought to the cognizance of the Umpire in case of a disagreement of the Commissioners and if then the Umpire should allow such petition.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>175 Thus the question of the right to reopen a case already decided by the con- currence of the two Commissioners involves also the " subquestion " whether in case of dissens of the two Commissioners on the reopening question the Umpire by his sole authority can have the power to pass on the merits of such case and eventually to reopen it. That this cannot be the meaning of the Agreement seems to me undeniable.</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1933-7"><span class="para-num">7.</span><p>It is hardly necessary to explain here that the Commission's practice to alter a decision wherever it found that an error in its findings of fact on the evidence produced at the time the claim was submitted or in applying the principles of law and the rules of the Commission had influenced the decision, has nothing whatever to do with the question of reopening on the ground of new evidence. In pursuance of this practice the Commissioners have acted unanimously. Moreover they left the basis of their decision to wit the facts as produced and the law and rules applicable thereto unchanged and merely were willing to correct their conclusions derived therefrom. I more than doubt whether the Agents be it by mutual consent be it on their separate volition had ever a right to ask for such alteration. But certainly it was practical and sound that the Commission adopted this procedure. And it is significant that actually the Commission never changed a decision except with the consent not only of both Commissioners but also of both Agents.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1933-8"><span class="para-num">8.</span><p>This leads to the question also ignored in the argument by the American Agent whether under the assumption that the Commission as such could reopen a case because of new evidence, such power would be vested in it even if not only one of the Commissioners but also one of the Agents would oppose such measure. That such ex parte measure would not only be outside of the provisions of the Agreement but also outside of any law be it national be it international, is so manifest that no further reasoning is necessary to refute it. In my mind all these reasons stand so obviously against not only the right of the Commission to reopen a case but also against the right of the Umpire to reopen on his sole authority a case already decided by the two Commissioners that according to my opinion the petition of the American Agent must be denied.

<p>The undersigned, accordingly, certifies to the Umpire of the Commission for decision the questions of difference between the national Commissioners arising out of the pending petition in the sabotage cases, and as shown by this certificate of disagreement and by the respective opinions, above set forth, with reference to that petition. Done at Washington, October 21, 1933. Chandler P. ANDERSON American Commissioner Washington, D.C., November 22, 1933 The Honorable Owen J. Roberts, Justice, Supreme Court of the United States, Umpire, German American Mixed Claims Commission, Washington, D.C. Sir: In accordance with your statement at the close of the meeting of the Com- mission October 31, 1933, which was recorded in the minutes as follows:</p>

<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>" it is understood that it is the position of the German Agent that he is not authorized to take any part in this proceeding, and the Umpire further stated that the Umpire will be entirely willing to receive any observations or representations the German Agent may wish to make in the pending matter and he is willing to receive such as in the nature of a special appearance as not conceding anything and without pre- judice to the position of the German Agent's Government before the Commission,'* I have the honor to submit to you herewith certain observations of Dr. Wilhelm Kiesselbach. the German Commissioner, which were sent me by cable through the intermediary of the German Foreign Office. Believe me, Yours very sincerely, Dr. Joh. G. LOHMANN German Agent [Additional Opinion of German Commissioner.] I wish to add to my opinion of May 6, 1933 the following: From the very beginning my view has been that a distinction must be made between a court on which the power to reopen has been conferred and a court which has no such power. In the first alternative the court would in its discretion have authority to reopen a case even if one of the parties concerned objects. In the second alternative the court has no right whatever to reopen if one of the parties objects. The agreement of August 10th, 1922, does not confer such authority upon the Commission. On the contrary, from the clear and unambiguous wording of Art. 6, paragraph 3 it appears that the decisions (not the decision) of the commission shall be final and binding upon the two Governments. If never- theless a petition for reopening is filed the Commission is bound to pass upon it, but to deny it, if and as far as one Government opposes it. Already in July 1928 I have stated this opinion of mine in a memorandum a to the other members of the Commission in connection with a petition for rehearing. So far my memorandum reads as follows: '' Under our charting an award is binding upon both Governments. Only when the Commissioners disagree the Umpire comes into action. But here both Commis- sioners have agreed upon the award and the Umpire, though having joined the Commissioners' decision, has not acquired jurisdiction. It is therefore to the Com- missioners, and to the Commissioners only, to pass upon the motion of a second rehearing. Whether they can grant such motion by mutual consent is — under the provision of the August Agreement — a very close question. But it seems clear to me that not one of them can do so against the protest of the other. And it seems further to be clear that in case of such a dissense the lack of the right ofa single Commissioner to grant a rehearing cannot be supplemented by transferring this question to the jurisdiction of the Umpire's." I have no doubt that this is also the view of my Government as clearly stated in the letter of the Embassy of October 11th and as I know for certain, this was also in the mind of the German Agent when answering the Umpire's question in the last Washington argument. And the same view was taken by me with regard to the Umpire's decision of December 3, 1932, which did not imply a decision on the question of reopening. From the foregoing it clearly appears that at least from my viewpoint the rules of the Commission do not imply the Commission's authority to reconsider a No such memorandum in the records of Commission, see pp. 1111 et seq. (Note by the Secretariat, this volume, pp. 179 et seq.)</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>177 a case. On the contrary I never left any doubt that I thought a reopening impossible against an objection from one side. It was for this reason that I relied on the principal statement of the Commission's decision denying a petition for reopening as recited by the American Commissioner in his opinion Page 7 [p. 1090, this print],1 saying that the rules of this Commission con- forming to the practice of International Commissions make no provision for a rehearing. A statement which seemed to me the more clear and unambi- guous as it referred to the practice of international Commissions that is to the side of the principle of the question. If nevertheless the Commission dealt with the merits of the case that was done, as I understood it, in order to soothe the feelings of the parties concerned. This is what I have to add to my opinion dealing with the question of the power of this Commission to reopen a case. It is unnecessary to say that my argument is still stronger if we have to deal, as is the case here, with the question of reopening a case dismissed not by one but by two decisions rendered on it. KlESSELBACH Supplemental Opinion by the American Commissioner In the proceedings now pending before the Umpire on the question of the jurisdiction of the Commission to reconsider its decisions in the so-called sabo- tage cases, each of the national Commissioners has filed his opinion in support of their respective contentions as to the questions in disagreement, and the German Commissioner has now filed with the Umpire, on November 22, 1933, an additional opinion in reply to the original opinion filed by the American Commissioner. In reply to this additional opinion, the present memorandum by the Ameri- can Commissioner is now filed with the Umpire as a supplemental opinion. The German Commissioner states at the outset of his additional opinion that it is an addition to his opinion of May 6, 1933, already filed with the Um- pire. At the time the German Commissioner's original opinion was filed, he stated in his letter of May 5, 1933, to the American Commissioner (see minutes of meeting of October 31, 1933 1 that he was under instructions from his Government " to bring now the question whether or not our Commission has the right to reopen, to a final decision ". He, therefore, inclosed a copy of his opinion, but reserved the right to amend and supplement it if the American Commissioner should prepare an opinion in disagreement, and he suggested, " in order to expedite the matter ", that such opinion should be sent to him by the American Commissioner with a Certificate of Disagreement, to be signed and returned by the German Commissioner together with his final opinion. This proposed procedure has since been carried out, and now that the German Commissioner's opinion is in final form, as supplemented by the recent addition thereto, and the American Commissioner does hereby file his supple- mental opinion in reply, in accordance with the reservation noted by him, the questions at issue between the two national Commissioners are now finally before the Umpire with authority to render the decision of the Commission thereon. Inasmuch as the German Commissioner's additional opinion now under consideration is, as above noted, merely an addition to his original opinion, its purpose must be understood to be the same as that of the original opinion, which, as above stated, was to bring "to a final decision the fundamental a Mote by the Secretariat, this volume, pp. 164-165. 1 See Appendix.

<p>question of whether or not our Commission has the right to reopen a final decision ". Nevertheless, some confusion results from the position now taken by the German Commissioner in his additional opinion, to the effect that the Com- mission has not the right either through the national Commissioners, or, in case of their disagreement, through the Umpire, to determine its own juris- diction on the questions presented, thus, apparently, abandoning his original position. In short, he wants the judgment of the German Government sub- stituted for the judgment of the Commission on the question of its jurisdictional authority, and on this point the two Governments are in disagreement. The German Commissioner frankly admits, although denying any authority to reopen, that " If, nevertheless, a petition for reopening is filed, the Commis- sion is bound to pass upon it, but to deny it, if and so far as one Government opposes it ". The only explanation which he gives of the uniform practice of the Com- mission in considering the merits of a case presented on a petition to reopen is that this was done " in order to soothe the feelings of the parties con- cerned". This idea of soothing the feelings of the parties does not appeal to the American Commissioner as a sufficient or even admissible basis for giving serious conside- ration to a reopening petition if in any event the Commission was bound to reject it. It is rather grotesque to suppose that if the Commission considered from the outset that it was without jurisdiction to reopen the sabotage decision, the feelings of the claimants would be soothed by being permitted and even encouraged to spend upwards of two years and many thousands of dollars in presenting evidence and arguments in support of their petition. Furthermore, the American Commissioner considers that this suggestion is a very serious reflection on the good faith and good sense of the Commission, and he rejects it as utterly without foundation so far as he is concerned. Whatever may be the view of the German Government on this point, the American Commissioner has no hesitation in saying that so far as his Govern- ment is concerned he is confident that an expenditure of time and money " to soothe the feelings " of the claimants by a futile gesture would be charac- terized as an unwarranted and inexcusable extension of the scope of its functions and duties. At the meeting of the Commission in Washington last November this very point was raised by the American Agent in his oral argument. He then said (Printed Record, Oral Arguments, page 243) : " There is a question which arises at the very threshold of these proceedings, and that is the jurisdictional question. " The German Agent opened his remarks by reading a statement; I am not certain whether it is intended as an argument or a protest on the part of Germany to this Commission considering the jurisdictional question. I thoroughly understand his position, that he does not want to be considered as having waived the jurisdictional question by discussing the evidence. But as I listened to the reading of that document it occurred to me that perhaps there was more than that intended by that document. " I am not sure what the attitude of Germany may be in reference to the juris- dictional question. I am not certain whether it is the attitude of Germany that it will not submit to this Commission jurisdictional questions for its consideration and determination. If that be the attitude of Germany, I think we should know it at the very beginning. I think we should have known it a year and a half ago. If that be the attitude of Germany, then all that has occurred during the past year and a half has been useless. If Germany takes the position that this Commission has no right to consider and determine the jurisdictional question, then this whole proceeding for the past year and a half has been little less than a farce.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>179 " If on the consideration and determination by the Commission of the evidence which has been submitted for a reconsideration of the decision of the Commission on October 16, 1930, the Commission should upon such determination decide that Germany is liable for both of these destructions, then, if Germany were to take the attitude that the decision of the Commission would not be binding on Germany, it means that Germany is simply submitting its evidence and considering these cases at the present time, but reserving to the end the position which the German Agent announced as the position of Germany, that this Commission has no jurisdiction or power to consider the question as to the right to reopen the case. I can hardly conceive that that is possible, and yet that may be what was intended by reading that protest at the very beginning of the argument." Then follows the dialogue between the Umpire and the German Agent, quoted in the American Commissioner's original opinion, containing the explicit admission by the German Agent that the question of the Commission's jurisdiction is a justiciable question to be submitted to the Commission for decision. The German Commissioner asserts that long before the question of reopening the sabotage decision arose he was on record as denying the authority of the Commission to reconsider a decision. The original decision in those cases was rendered in October, 1930, but he says, "Already in July, 1928, I have stated this opinion of mine in a memorandum to the other members of the Commission in connection with a petition for rehearing." It may be noted in passing, although it is not regarded as of importance in the present discussion, that so far as the records of the American Commissioner, or of the then Umpire disclose, no copy of or reference to the memorandum mentioned can be found. The records show that the German Commissioner was in Hamburg at the date of that memorandum, so it could have been communicated to the other members of the Commission only by mail or cable, but the records of the American Commissioner show that only three letters passed between him and the German Commissioner during the Summer of 1928, and they were all of a distinctly personal nature. Moreover, it has not been possible to identify the case to which the memorandum referred. The only case which seems to resemble it is the Frank case, Docket No. 8130, in which an interlocutory award was made on March 13, 1928, and an order denying a motion to reopen was entered June 14, 1928, and a final award was entered January 31, 1929. But the Umpire did not participate in entering either the order or the award in that case, so that the question of the participa- tion by the Umpire discussed in the 1928 Memorandum was not presented in that case. In response to a cabled inquiry, a cable has just been received from the German Commissioner, dated November 25, 1933, in which he says: " Cannot remember name of case not does my copy show it but memorandum deals with estate case in which we had oral argument and rendered decision with reasons on question of obligation to distribute. Bonynge was very insistent therefore I thought it important and wrote memorandum for you and Parker. (Signed) Kiesselbach." In any event, it is clear from the recorded decisions of the Commission that no decision in accordance with the views expressed by the German Commissio- ner in the Memorandum of July, 1928, was ever rendered by the Commission. At that time no case was pending presenting for decision the questions therein discussed. The sabotage re-argument petitions were not filed until January, 1931, and it has been stated over and over, with the concurrence of all concer- ned, that the Commission has never rendered a decision on the jurisdictional question mentioned, which has always been reserved for decision at the close of the reopening proceedings in the sabotage cases.</p>

<p>This memorandum of July, 1928, therefore, has not the importance of an expression of opinion by the Commission, although it is fully conceded to have all the importance to which an expression of opinion by the German Commissioner is entitled. That memorandum is to be considered, therefore, solely from that point of view. As quoted in the German Commissioner's additional opinion, the memo- randum under consideration reads as follows : " Under our charting an award is binding upon both Governments. Only when the Commissioners disagree the Umpire comes into action. But here both the Commis- sioners have agreed upon the award, and the Umpire, though having joined the Commissioners' decision, has not acquired jurisdiction. It is therefore to the Com- missioners, and to the Commissioners only, to pass upon the motion of a second rehearing. Whether they can grant such motion by mutual consent is — under the provision of the August Agreement — a very close question. But it seems clear to me that not one of them can do so against the protest of the other. And it seems further to be clear that in case of such a dissent the lack of the right of a single Commissioner to grant a rehearing cannot be supplemented by transferring this question to the jurisdiction of the Umpire." The conclusion of the German Commissioner in this memorandum is three- fold. First, he is not sure that the two national Commissioners by mutual consent can change an award. Nevertheless, the German Commissioner has joined with the American Commissioner in many cases in revising awards by mutual consent. Second, he says. " it seems clear to me that not one " of the Commissioners can grant such a motion against the protest of the other. With this conclusion the American Commissioner agrees. Finally, he says, " it seems further to be clear that in case of such a dissent the lack of the right of a single Commissioner to grant a rehearing cannot be supplemented by trans- ferring this question to the jurisdiction of the Umpire ". With this conclusion the American Commissioner disagrees. It seems to the American Commissioner that the German Commissioner's final conclusion destroys itself by going too far. It goes to the extent of nulli- fying the provision of the Agreement of August 10, 1922 (Article II), that the Umpire is authorized " to decide upon any cases concerning which the Com- missioners may disagree, or upon any points of difference that may arise in the course of their proceedings ". The question discussed by the German Commissioner clearly involves a " point of difference " arising between the two national Commissioners in the course of their proceedings, and to deny the right of the Umpire to decide upon it is to deny a right expressly conferred upon him by the Agreement establishing the Commission. The German Commissioner says in his additional opinion that he has no doubt that the view expressed in his above quoted memorandum of July, 1928, •" is also the view of my Government as clearly stated in the letter of the Em- bassy of October 11, and as I know for certain, this was also in the mind of the German Agent when answering the Umpire's question in the last Washing- ton argument ". It must be noted that the view expressed in the 1928 memorandum dealt solely with the question of the authority of the national Commissioners to reopen by mutual consent a previous decision, or, failing that, the jurisdiction of the Umpire to act upon the questions presented by their disagreement. This was a distinctly different question from that raised by the German Em- bassy's letter of October 11th, which challenged the right of the Commission as a whole " to pass upon a difference of opinion which may exist between the two Governments in this connection ".</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>181 So, also, in saying that he knew for certain that the view expressed by him in his 1928 memorandum was also in the mind of the German Agent when answering the Umpire's question on the oral argument, he has not clearly distinguished in his own mind the question of the jurisdiction of the Commission on which the national Commissioners are in disagreement, and the question of disagreement between the two Governments as to the Commission's juris- diction as a whole. The former issue was all that he was discussing in his 1928 memorandum, but the latter issue was distinctly presented in the question put to the German Agent by the Umpire on the last oral argument. The Umpire then pointed out to the German Agent that the Commission understood that his position was that the Treaty (Agreement of August 10, 1922) should be construed as conferring no power upon the Commission to review the sabotage cases, but not that the Commission could not consider that question and determine its own jurisdiction under the Agreement. The German Agent replied that " The understanding of the Commission is entirely correct." The Umpire then added. " In other words that is a justiciable question? ", to which the German Agent answered, " Yes." Therefore, even if the views expressed by the German Commissioner in his 1928 memorandum were in the mind of the German Agent when answering the Umpire's question, those views would not have affected his answer. The American Commissioner also calls attention to the statement in the German Commissioner's additional opinion that " the Umpire's decision of December 3, 1932, did not imply a decision on the question of reopening ". The American Commissioner considers that the views expressed by the Umpire in that decision, as for instance, the conclusiveness of the Blue Book magazine message as decisive in favor of the claimants if authentic, distinctly imply that he was prepared to decide the petition in favor of the claimants if the facts satisfied him that he was justified in exercising a jurisdictional and discretionary authority to reopen the decision in those cases on the merits. The other points raised by the German Commissioner's additional opinion have already been covered by the original opinion of the American Commissio- ner, and do not seem to call for any additional comment now. It may be noted, however, that the German Commissioner contends that the recital by the Commission in its orders of dismissal that the rules of the Commission " conforming to the practice of international commissions make no provision for a rehearing" is an admission of lack of jurisdiction. This contention is met by the American Commissioner's statement in the original opinion that " the Commission cannot announce in advance any general rule as to how this right will be exercised because that would depend in each case on whether or not the facts presented satisfied the Commission that in its discretion the right should be exercised ". In conclusion the American Commissioner considers that the original position taken by the German Government, through its Agent, in the oral argument, and by the German Commissioner in his letter of May 5th to the American Commissioner, that this jurisdictional question is one to be decided by the Commission, is the correct position. The new position now taken by the German Government that this jurisdictional question cannot be adjudicated by the Commission is not admissible. As stated by the American Commissioner at the last meeting of the Commission (minutes of meeting of October 31, 1933), " The American Commissioner regards this attitude of the German Government as an attempt to limit, without the consent of the Government of the United States, the jurisdiction conferred upon the Commission by the two Governments in their Agreement of August 10, 1922, in order to determine independently of the Commission, and upon political or other considerations, 13</p>

<p>questions submitted by virtue of that Agreement to the Commission for decision on purely legal grounds." Done at Washington, this 27th day of November, 1933. Chandler P. ANDERSON American Commissioner Decision of the Commission The national Commissioners are in disagreement upon certain questions arising in these cases. These questions will best be understood by a brief statement concerning the history of the proceedings. The memorials were filed by the American Agent in the Black Tom case on March 16, 1927, and in the Kingsland case on March 26, 1927. The answers of Germany were filed on December 14, 1927, and January 17, 1928, respectively. Both Governments assembled evidence before and after the filing of the memorials. With considerable further evidence presented after the premature argument of April 3-12, 1929, the cases of the respective Govern- ments again appeared to be completed so that submission and oral argument could be had in April, 1930. It then developed that some evidence had recently been elicited on behalf of the United States which made it certain that both Governments would wish to file additional evidence, so the hearing was by agreement adjourned to September 18, 1930, and both Governments sub- mitted their cases at The Hague September 18-30, 1930, on the record as then made. The Commission reached its decision dismissing both cases on Octo- ber 16 and communicated it to the two Governments on November 13, 1930. On January 12 and 22, 1931, the American Agent filed petitions for rehearing and reconsideration, which assigned as reasons for the requested action that the Commission had misapprehended the facts and committed errors of law. These petitions were considered and dismissed by the Commission in an opinion of March 30, 1931. On the same date the Commission addressed a letter to the two Agents in which it said: " In the decision handed down today in the Sabotage Cases the Commission has decided the matter of rehearings in these cases so far as the rehearing petitions therein are based on allegations of obvious error. This decision is related to the record as it stood when the cases were decided, and the decision reserves the question of the proposed admission of new evidence, which is a separate question. " The Commission asks me to advise you that it desires the two Agents, without waiting for the presentation of any additional new evidence, to submit briefs discussing, first, the jurisdictional considerations and legal principles which should govern the Commission's decision as to the admission of new evidence in these cases, and, second, what kind of new evidence, if any, should be admitted. " The Commission in this connection points out that the two Agents have already presented some argument on the question of new evidence and each Agent has based his argument in part on the decision of the Commission in the Philadelphia- Girard National Bank case. To avoid further discussion as to the proper inter- pretation of the language used by the Commission in that case we think it best to advise you that the National Commissioners are agreed that it was the intention of the Commission in that decision to rule against the introduction of further evidence of any kind after the evidence had once been closed and a decision promulgated. This ruling is not irrevocable, but it is desirable that argument addressed to the question should be devoted not to the interpretation of that language but to the principle itself. The Commission has not seen the new evidence offered by the American Agent in the Sabotage Cases, but the descriptions of this evidence in his motions filed March 5 and 11, 1931, give the impression that the evidence offered is not new and is not of the character which courts admit after a decision is once made in cases where, after a decision, they admit any new evidence.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>183 " The Commission accordingly requests that the Agents file their briefs on the points above mentioned within two weeks, with leave to each Agent to file a reply brief within one week after the receipt of the other Agent's brief." Pursuant to this letter briefs on the question of the Commission's power to reopen and rehear were filed April 27, 1931. Reply briefs were not filed, for reasons not necessary to state here. On July 1, 1931, the American Agent presented a supplementary petition for rehearing covering both cases, on the ground of newly-discovered evidence, and in it set forth that he had procured much additional evidence, some of which had been filed and the balance of which was being filed with the petition. The German Agent offered no evi- dence (he tendered none from the time of The Hague argument until January 9, 1932). A hearing was had at Boston July 30-August 1, 1931. The Commission did not pass upon its power to reopen and rehear the cases at that time, but reserved that question until it should have opportunity to examine the new evidence filed. The Commission then stated that perhaps it would need the assistance of an impartial expert to be retained by it to assist it in appraising certain of the documentary evidence filed by the American Agent. This matter was under advisement for some time, and on October 14, 1931, the Umpire, with the concurrence of the Commissioners, forwarded a joint letter to the two Agents stating as follows: " It has proved impossible to carry out the American Agent's suggestion that Mr. Osborn be employed by the Commission. Mr. Osborn himself is unwilling; the American Agent now objects; the German Agent's consent is subject to restrictions, and the Commission could not accept restrictions. The Commission hasnowdecided not to make further search for a satisfactory expert. In view of Mr. Osborn's standing in his profession, we would welcome the presentation of his testimony if the German Agent himself desires to offer it. The Commission still reserves its decision as to its right to admit new evidence in these cases." Pursuant to this letter the German Agent on January 9, 1932, filed an affidavit by A. S. Osborn with certain annexes and over a period from January 9 to August 15-29, 1932, filed additional annexes to Osborn's affidavit. The present Umpire was appointed to fill the vacancy, caused by Mr. Boyden's death, on March 24, 1932, and on April 8, 1932. a session of the Commission was held in order to bring the matter to a head and end the existing confusion. Pursuant to the agreement of the two national Agents an order was entered to the effect that the American Agent should conclude the filing of his evidence in support of his supplementary petition on or before June 1, 1932, and the German Agent file any evidence he cared to present in reply on or before August 15, that briefs should be exchanged and filed on or before September 15. and that the matter should be argued beginning November 1, 1932. The American Agent reserved no right to file reply evidence to that presented by the German Agent but he did assemble reply evidence, and, in order to give him additional time for its presentation, he was allowed until November 15 and the hearing was adjourned to November 21. Permission was also given to both Agents to file briefs not later than the close of the argu- ment. It will be observed that during the entire period from March 30, 1931, to November 21. 1932, what had occurred was subject to the decision of the question of the Commission's jurisdiction to reopen the cases. By mutual consent the hearing of November 21-25, 1932, was without prejudice to Germany's objection to the Commission's jurisdiction, all agreeing that if the new evidence filed would not change the result reached in the decision of October 16, 1930, the jurisdictional question need not be answered. The national Commissioners disagreed as to the effect of the new evidence, and the question of its effect therefore came to the Umpire for decision. He rendered</p>
<p>184</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>the decision of the Commission of December 3, 1932, holding the new evidence not sufficient to change the original findings and dismissing the petitions for rehearing. The matter had gotten into such shape that the method of procedure adopted seemed the only practicable one. It was at best an unsatisfactory method, and — without meaning any criticism of anyone — I am convinced, as the matter is now viewed in retrospect, it would have been fairer to both the parties definitely to pass in the first instance upon the question of the Commission's power to entertain the supplementary petition for rehearing, as requested on May 27, 1931, by the American Agent. The reception or rejection of the new evidence would have been a consequence of the decision of that question. As will be seen from the decision of December 3, 1932, Germany insisted upon its objection to the jurisdiction of the Commission to rehear, and the United States asserted that the Commission had such jurisdiction. The German Commissioner reserved the question in the certificate of disagreement upon which the Umpire's functioning was grounded. On May 4, 1933, a single petition was filed by the American Agent (signed by four firms of private counsel for claimants and countersigned by the Ameri- can Agent) for a rehearing of both cases, which averred (1) "That certain important witnesses for Germany, in affidavits filed in evidence by Germany, furnished fraudulent, incomplete, collusive and false evidence which misled the Commission and unfairly prejudiced the cases of the claimants ", (2) " That there are certain witnesses within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States", some of whom are specifically named in the petition, "who have knowledge of facts and can give evidence adequate to convince the Commission of the liability of Germany for the destruction of the Black Tom Terminal and the Kingsland plant, but whose testimony cannot be obtained without authority to issue subpoenas and to subject such witnesses to penalties for failure to testify fully and truthfully ", (3) that evidence can be produced " to show that the Commission has been misled by the German evidence ", (4) " That there has also come to light evidence of collusion between certain German and American witnesses of a most serious nature to defeat these claims." This petition was filed with the proper officers of the Commission, but no action has been taken upon it. In May, 1933, the Umpire was apprised of the disagreement of the American and German Commissioners with respect to the power of the Commission to entertain the application. The German Commissioner by letter of May 5, 1933, addressed to the Umpire, enclosing a copy of his letter to the American Commissioner of even date and a copy of his opinion on the question of reope- ning, brought the situation to the attention of the Umpire. The German Com- missioner's letter is as follows : " Hamburg, May 5th, 1933 " My dear Mr. Justice, " I beg to hand you herewith a copy of a letter I wrote to Mr. Anderson and also a copy of an opinion I wrote on the question whether or not our Commission has the right to reopen a case. " Though from a strictly formal point of view you, as our Umpire, are not interested in the question but after it has been certified to you by the two National Commissioners, I feel it is my duty to keep you informed on what is going on, since I am afraid that Mr. Anderson and I might not agree on the issue. " I remain, my dear Mr. Justice, very sincerely yours, " Mr. Justice Owen J. Roberts, (Signed) W. KIESSELBACH United States Supreme Court, Washington D. C."</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>185 His letter to the American Commissioner appears in the minutes of the Commission's meeting of October 31, 1933, : and his opinion enclosed therewith and the American Commissioner's opinion are embodied in the American Commissioner's certificate of disagreement handed to the Umpire at that meeting. An additional opinion of the German Commissioner was filed on November 22 and a supplemental opinion of the American Commissioner on November 27. The foregoing statement will serve to disclose the nature of the points upon which the Commissioners are in disagreement. A preliminary question of procedure arises which must also be decided. It may be stated as follows: May the Umpire, in the absence of a joint certificate submitting that question to the Umpire, decide a question as to which the two national Commissioners are in disagreement? If this preliminary question be answered in the affirma- tive, then two others of substance remain for decision, as follows: Has the Commission the power to pass upon the extent of its own jurisdiction? If it has, then does this jurisdiction extend to the reopening of a case, once decided, by reason of after-discovered evidence, or disclosure that testimony offered was fraudulent, or a showing of collusion between witnesses for the two Governments, and that, in consequence, the Commission was misled by the record as made at the time of its decision? Orderly procedure would have required that these issues be decided by the Umpire before the filing of the tendered evidence, since the right to tender such evidence is involved in the decision. The American Agent has, as I am advised, filed a very large quantity of evidence, which, in view of the questions of power now mooted, I have thought it improper to examine or to treat as forming part of the record in the cases. Addressing myself to the preliminary question of procedure, 1 conclude that the disagreement of the national Commissioners is before me in such manner as to make it my duty, under the Agreement of August 10, 1922, between the two Governments, to take cognizance of the disagreement and decide the questions involved. The Agreement provides, in Article II, " The two Gov- ernments shall by agreement select an umpire to decide upon any cases con- cerning which the commissioners may disagree, or upon any points of difference that may arise in the course of their proceedings." The duty of the Umpire under the plain terms of the document arises automatically upon a disagreement between the Commissioners and his being apprised thereof. Under the Agree- ment no formal act is required to bring into operation the authority thus vested in the Umpire. Rule VIII (a), entered February 14, 1924 (amending that rule as originally enacted on November 15, 1922), reads: " The two National Commissioners will certify in writing to the Umpire for decision (1) any case or cases concerning which the Commissioners may disagree, or (2) any point or points of difference that may arise in the course of their proceedings, accom- panied or supplemented by any statement in writing which either of them may desire to make of his opinion with respect to the decision of the case or cases or point or points of difference certified." But rules adopted by the Commission as a matter of its own convenience and for the guidance of the national Agents can not contravene the explicit terms of the instrument which created the Com- mission. This brings me to the questions of substance. May the Commission pass upon its own jurisdiction? The Agreement of the two Governments created the Commission to deal with three classes of claims specified in Article I arising by reason of obligations undertaken by Germany under the Treaty of Berlin of August 25, 1921. 1 See Appendix. (Mote by the Secretariat, this volume, Appendix IV (A), p. 483.)</p>
<p>186</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>While at the date of the execution of the Agreement. August 10, 1922. it was known that such claims would be numerous and amount in the total to a huge sum. the nature and the validity of the separate claims which might be sub- mitted were unknown. It was for the purpose of passing upon these claims, both as to validity and amount, that the Commission was created. At the very threshold the tribunal might encounter in each case the question whether the claim presented fell within the categories of those to be adjudicated or was outside the scope of the Treaty and the Agreement. In this aspect the Commission was bound to determine its own jurisdiction, and for that purpose to interpret and apply the terms of the Agreement which created it. A decision that it had jurisdiction of a claim was by the very terms of the Agreement to be accepted by both Governments as final and binding upon them (Article VI). The Agreement submits the questions for decision as between the two Governments to the Commission. What those questions are must be determined within the four corners of the instrument. It is not within the com- petency of either Government to retract the authority which it conferred upon the Commission. If that body may not from the terms of the Agreement ascertain what power was conferred, it would be wholly incompetent to act except in an advisory capacity, and none of its decisions could in the nature of the case be accepted as final and binding by the Governments, as the Agree- ment states they shall be. How the Commission shall proceed with its task, the form of pleading to be adopted, the manner of hearing (subject to what is hereafter stated in respect of Article VI). the form and entry of its decisions, its control over a case after a decision is rendered, are all left to its determination and regulation. The Agreement is to be read in the light of its language and its purpose; and where it is silent, the powers and duties of the Commission are to be deter- mined according to the nature of the function entrusted to it. I have no doubt that the Commission is competent to determine its own jurisdiction by the interpretation of the Agreement creating it. Any other view would lead to the most absurd results — results which obviously the two Governments did not intend. This brings me to the second question of substance. Has the Commission the power to reopen a case upon the showing made by the pending petition? The answer to this question must also be found in the terms of the Agreement creating the Commission. On the one hand it is pointed out that the preamble refers to the desire of the parties that the " amount to be paid by Germany in satisfaction of Germany's financial obligations * * * " be determined. The fact that " amount " is singular rather than plural and while various claims of American citizens and the Government are involved, in the ultimate Germany is to pay a total ascertained by the addition of all the claims allowed, is said to make the Commission the arbiter of a single suit or action consisting of thousands of counts, each count representing the claim of an American national or of the Government of the United States. It is insisted that the Com- mission is limited by a few covenants, rules, or directions to be found in the Agreement, that it may proceed practically as it sees fit to accomplish the task committed to it. that its only concern is justice and equity as between the Nations signatory to the Agreement, and that if in justice and equity it should rehear a case nothing in the Agreement or in the constitution of the Commission stands in the way. The argument is that in effect the tribunal sits without terms or sessions as a continuing tribunal, trying a single case, and its doors are never closed to the litigants before it until it shall have completed this task and formally disbanded.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>187 On the other hand it is contended that each of the claims presented con- stitutes a case within the meaning of the Agreement; that each is initiated by a petition or memorial to which an answer is filed, thus making up an issue for trial; that it was intended, when the Commission reached a decision in any such case, the decision should be final and binding upon the parties; that the Commission is without power, once it has rendered its decision in a case, to reopen or rehear it for any reason. I think these positions are both extreme and that neither represents the true construction of the Agreement or an accurate definition of the Commission's powers. I am not persuaded that the use of the word " amount " in the preamble makes the Commission a tribunal to try a single action divided into counts. There is much to indicate that, while the total of the awards is to be taken to make up the amount due by Germany, the claims presented are to be treated as individual cases. Thus in Article II, where reference is made to the selection of the Umpire, his function is amongst other things specified as " to decide upon any cases concerning which the commissioners may disagree, * * * ". And cases are in this sentence distinguished from questions. Article IV provides that " The commissioners shall keep an accurate record of the questions and cases submitted * * * ". The uniform practice of the Commission indi- cates this understanding of its function, for each claim has been treated as initiating a separate case and has eventuated in a separate decision (a decision of it as a separate case: even though as a convenience the Commission in one document frequently dismissed a number of claims and less frequently rendered awards in a number of cases, each received the same treatment as if the decision thereof had been expressed in a record devoted to it alone). On the part of the United States this method of dealing with the claims has been recognized in the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 where provision is made for the certification to the Treasury of the awards of the Commission as they are made upon individual claims. My view is that the Commission is a tribunal sitting continuously with all the attributes and functions of a continuing tribunal until its work shall have been closed; and that as such tribunal it is engaged in the trial and adjudication of a large number of separate and individual cases. The German Government would have me draw from these premises the ultimate conclusion that the Commission is without power to reopen any case in which it has made a decision, and in support of this view refers to the last paragraph of Article VI, which provides " The decisions of the commission and those of the umpire (in case there may be any) shall be accepted as final and binding upon the two Governments." This paragraph, in my judgment, furnishes no aid to the German argument. It is a covenant as between the two Nations binding each of them with respect to any decisions which may be made. But it is to be observed that neither this paragraph nor any other provision of the Agreement purports to define what is or what shall be considered a " decision of the commission ". It is left to the Commission to determine when its decision upon any claim is final. It has no concern with the action taken in consequence of its awards. It is a matter for the two sovereigns to carry out their agreement that they shall accept the decisions as final and binding. If a decision should be revised by the Commission as a result of a rehearing and a new decision reached in a particular case, the Commission would have no concern with the adjustment of the settlement consequent upon its action. A court may often render a judgment which, by reason of what has occured, it is not possible to execute in accordance with its terms, but the mere fact that the judgment may be incapable of execution</p>
<p>188</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>in part or in whole in no way alters the jurisdiction of the tribunal or indeed its duty to render such judgment as to justice and right may appertain. With this preliminary general statement as to the jurisdiction of the Com- mission, I address myself to a determination of its power to reopen a case in which it has rendered a decision.</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1933-1"><span class="para-num">1.</span><p>I think it clear that where the Commission has misinterpreted the evidence, or made a mistake in calculation, or where its decision does not follow its fact findings, or where in any other respect the decision does not comport with the record as made, or where the decision involves a material error of law, the Commission not only has power, but is under the duty, upon a proper showing, to reopen and correct a decision to accord with the facts and the applicable legal rules. My understanding is that the Commission has repeatedly done so where there was palpable error in its decisions. It is said on behalf of Germany that this has never been done except where the two Agents agreed that such course under the circumstances was proper. And the argument is drawn from this fact that the Commission is without power to take such action of its own motion or in the face of opposition by either Agent. I can not follow this argument. If the Commission's decisions once made are final and the body wholly without power to reopen them, then a case once decided can only be reopened by a formal agreement of the two Governments amending the Agreement under which the Commission sits, for no additional power can be conferred upon the tribunal except by the parties who called it into being and gave whatever jurisdiction it originally possessed. If, therefore, a case may be reopened by consent, the same action may be taken without consent. The first petition for reopening and rehearing filed in these cases by the American Agent was based in grounds such as are above described. I have no doubt that the Com- mission had power to consider that petition and to deal with the case in the light of the matters it brought forward.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1933-2"><span class="para-num">2.</span><p>I come now to the question of jurisdiction to reopen for the presentation of what is usually known in judicial procedure as after-discovered evidence. I am of opinion that the Commission has no such power. In cases where a retrial is granted or a reopening and rehearing indulged for the submission of so-called after-discovered evidence, this is usually by a court. It is to the interest of the public that litigation be terminated, and municipal tribunals have the power to set a case for trial and to compel the parties to proceed. While they will not compel a litigant to proceed without hearing his reasons for delay, neither party has a right to hold the case open until he feels that he has exhausted all possible means of obtaining evidence. If such right existed, courts would be unable to function. By analogy, if this Commission had the power to make an order to close the proofs in any case and compel the parties to proceed, either party who was not then ready, because it had not exhausted its sources of information and evidence, might well have an equity to ask a reopening that it might be permitted to offer evidence theretofore unavailable. But the situation here is quite otherwise. Article VI, second paragraph, provides " The commission shall receive and consider all written statements or documents which may be presented to it by or on behalf of the respective Governments in support of or in answer to any claim." All must admit the parties intended the Commission should not sit indefinitely but should expedi- tiously complete its work. The Agreement provides that all claims to be considered must be brought to the Commission's attention within six months of its first session. But, on the other hand, no time limit whatever was set in</p></div>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>189 the original Agreement for the closing of proofs. In contradistinction, such a mandatory provision for closing proofs was embodied in the supplementary Agreement of December 31, 1928, as to claims embraced within the scope of that instrument. The Commission has from its inception been sensible of its lack of power to compel the closing of the record and the final submission of any case. While it has urged the Agents to complete their records and to submit and argue their cases upon such completion and has sought the cooperation of the Agents to bring the cases to final submission, it has never, as I am advised, entered an order for the final closing of the record in any case without consent or over objection. I do not think it has power so do to. The clause quoted from Article VI compels the reception of any written statement or document pre- sented by either party. As I read this provision, so long as either party is of opinion that written statements or documents are or may be available in support of its contention it may of right demand that the Commission await the filing thereof before final submission of the cause. The American Agent was under no obligation to close his record and submit his case at The Hague if he knew, or had reason to expect, that further evidence was obtainable. It is suggested in the petition for reopening that the United States was unable to obtain the evidence from certain witnesses without the power to compel their testimony. This fact was as obvious in the autumn of 1930 as it is today. The German Government availed itself of its ordinance of June 28, 1923, which permitted the summoning of witnesses, placing them under oath, examining them before a court, and rendering them liable to penalty for false-swearing. No reason is apparent why a similar statute could not at any time have been adopted in the United States. The best evidence that it could is that when the American Agent and the Department of State requested the passage of such a law it was promptly enacted and has been availed of in obtaining evidence now proffered (Act of June 7, 1933). The lack of an instrument which would have been ready to hand if requested can not excuse the failure to obtain the testimony thereby obtainable. The Agreement does not contemplate that when the two Agents signify their readiness to submit a case and do submit it upon the record as then made to their satisfaction, obtain a hearing and decision thereon, the Commission shall have power to permit either Agent to add evidence to the record and to reconsider the case upon a new record thus made.</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1933-3"><span class="para-num">3.</span><p>The petition now under consideration presents, in the main, a situation different from either of those above discussed. Its allegations are that certain witnesses proffered by Germany furnished the Commission fraudulent, incom- plete, collusive, and false evidence which misled the Commission and unfairly prejudiced the claimants' cases; that certain witnesses, including some who previously testified, who are now within the United States, have knowledge and can give evidence which will convince the Commission that its decision was erroneous; that evidence has come to light showing collusion between certain German and American witnesses to defeat the claims. These are serious allegations, and I express no opinion of the adequacy of the evidence tendered by the American Agent to sustain them. I have refrained from examining the evidence because I thought it the proper course at this stage to decide the question of power on the assumption that the allegations of the petition may be supported by proof, postponing for the consideration of the Commission the probative value of the evidence tendered. The petition, in short, avers the Commission has been misled by fraud and collusion on the part of witnesses and suppression of evidence on the part of some of them. The Commission is not functus officio. It still sits as a court.</p></div>

<p>To it in that capacity are brought charges that it has been defrauded and misled by perjury, collusion, and suppression. No tribunal worthy its name or of any respect may allow its decision to stand if such allegations are well- founded. Every tribunal has inherent power to reopen and to revise a decision induced by fraud. If it may correct its own errors and mistakes, a fortiori it may, while it still has jurisdiction of a cause, correct errors into which it has been led by fraud and collusion. I am of opinion, therefore, that the Commission has power to reopen these cases, and should do so, in order that it may consider the further evidence tendered by the American Agent and, dependent upon its findings from that evidence and any that may be offered in reply on behalf of Germany, either confirm the decisions heretofore made or alter them as justice and right may demand.

<p>493 it desirable to give finality to the settlement heretofore reached in the Drier case. I agree with Your Excellency that the Commission shall not in future be asked to consider any new cases or cases already decided, other than the sabotage cases and the case of Mrs. Katherine McNider Drier. Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration. (Signed) Cordell HULL His Excellency Heir Hans LUTHER, Ambassador of Germany. (C) Excerpts from Minutes of Commisiionfor Meeting Held October 30, 1939, pp. 1725-1726 [Following the announcement of the decision of the Commission by the Umpire of October 30, 1939, in Docket No. 81 17, the Minutes then show that:] The American Commissioner then made the following statement: " In accordance with the order entered on June 15, 1939. the American Agent and the Acting American Agent prepared and submitted to the Commission for its approval memoranda relating to all the pending sabotage claims and the awards to be entered. " Some of the questions which have arisen in the study of these cases arc of a legal character, in which I have furnished the [p. 1726] Umpire memoranda of the Acting American Agent and memoranda prepared by me relating thereto. •' I have thoroughly examined the files for the purpose of determining the correct measure of damages in all of these cases, and have furnished the Umpire memoranda relating thereto. I have also furnished him memoranda prepared by the Acting American Agent relating to the question of damages. " Wherever the files disclosed that a question of fact or of law was raised, I have discussed it with the Umpire personally. I have presented to him for his consider- ation an award in each of the 153 sabotage cases." The Umpire then said that after a study of the data and the records and the memoranda prepared, he had found that the awards were, in his judgment, accu- rately and properly calculated, and that he had joined the American Commissioner in signing the awards and directed that these awards be entered and filed in the records of the Commission. Appendix V Copies of correspondence in March, and June, 1939, in relation to the retirement of the German Commissioner from the Commission, as set out at pages 1703-1713 of the Minutes of the Commission for the meeting held June 15, 1939; also copies of correspondence in October, 1939, between the German Embassy and the Depart- ment of State in relation to the work of the Commission, as set out as pages 1726- 1751 of the Minutes of the Commission for the meeting held October 30, 1939. [The Get man Commissioner to the Umpire] Deutsches Mitglied der Mixed Claims Commission 1439 Massachusetts Avenue Washington, D. C , The German Commissioner March 1, 1939. Mixed Claims Commission My dear Mr. Justice Roberts: I beg to apprise you of the fact that I retire from the post of German Member</p>
<p>494</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES GERMANY</h3>
<p>of the Mixed Claims Commission. Please consider running appointments as cancelled. The reasons for my step are these : Our deliberations began with discussing whether there was a prima facie case made out by the claimants and at once one fact became conspicuous: In respect to the largest of our claims you introduced as your main point a point which was not made by the claimants at all and which, as far as I am aware, never was argued. It may be recapitulated in a few sentences: When our Commission rendered their decision at the Hague, they had before them two American witnesses and one German witness [p. 1704] testifying to the central question. Our Commission did not believe the American witnesses and said so; neither did they believe the German witness, and they said so. In the reopening pleadings the testimony of the German witness is impugned by the claimants and the point which the claimants really make is: Had the Commission at that time known to what extent the German witness had been untruthful, then they would not have denied credence to the American witnesses with whom he was in contradiction. This point is logically impeccable, as I always have admitted; it makes the issue dependent on factual considerations which I always have been ready to consider. Instead of this point you introduced a totally different point (without being able by the way to substantiate it by any inter- national or even municipal decision) which enables you to dispense with any factual consideration at all : You assume that although the Commission denied credence to the German witness they were still decisively influenced by the fact that he came forward at all. And actually this consideration was for you the decisive one regarding the question of the prima facie case which we were then discussing, for what other reasons you advanced for your attitude did not relate to the largest case before us, so that in this case the reason indicated was your only reason. The grave irregularity created by your procedure was twofold. Fresh points introduced in as late a stage as the deliberations of the Court after the Argument make the other party defenseless. No opportunity is accorded to the defendants to show what they have to say against your views, and they may have to say a great deal. But the other point is still of greater weight. I cannot shut my eyes to thefact that in my opinion it is not compatible with the position of an Umpire and it shows a bias if the Umpire makes points and bases his decisions on them which are not advanced by the party [p. 1705] favored by them. The Umpire actually assumes by such a procedure the attitude of a legal adviser for the favored party and does so under circumstances under which the other side can no longer expect equal justice. The grave situation with which I felt myself confronted (especially when all my attempts to show you what I have just explained were of no avail at all) made it my duty to consider whether I could still cooperate in what was going on and what was to my mind no longer a really judicial procedure. It was perfectly clear to me that I was under a serious responsibility not to act hastily and to thoroughly con- sider the attitude which I had to take. But what accompanied the events described by me and what followed them in the next days only corroborated my original impression. My conviction that you had no longer an open mind deepened.</p>
<p>I could not overlook certain points as, for instance, this: A very fully substantiated factual German argument on a certain point was discarded by you solely on the ground that " It merely was a clever piece of advocacy"; when I insisted what your reason was to discard it so summarily, you gave a factual reason which I could show at once to be erroneous. Instead of now reconsidering your attitude, your answer merely was in an impatient voice " You may be quite sure that I do not care in the least for all that." But this instance obviously was only a symptom.</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">APPENDICES</h3>
<p>495 It has become clear to me during these days that any argument advanced by the claimants at once attracts your attention and evokes the idea, How could it be coi- roborated? Any argument advanced in favor of the defendants at once evokes in you the idea, How can it be refuted! As you told the American Commissioner and me, in many respects this case has been a disillusion to you and this has left a strong emotional feeling with you. I cannot be but afraid that this emotional feeling carries you away when I see to what extent the responsibility of German advocates and witnesses is stressed by you whilst on the other [p. 1706] hand you find no way to put in the balance what under the same heading may be alleged against the other side. The result to which I have come is that it is impossible for me to cooperate in a procedure which no longer offers to both parties equally the usual guarantees of a decision arrived at in a really judicial way. Our charter allows any member of the Commission to retire and this is the consequence which I have drawn. Faithfully yours. Dr. Victor L. F. H. HUECKING [The Umpire to Dr. Huecking] March 2.. 1939 Dr. Victor L. F. H. HUECKING, c/o German Embassy, 1439 Massachusetts Avenue, N. W., Washington, D. C. My dear Dr. Huecking: I have your letter of March 1, 1939, advising that you are retiring from the post of German member of the Mixed Claims Commission. I do not propose to enter into any controversy with respect to the statements contained in your letter other than to say that they are unjustified and, in my opinion, present a wholly false picture of our deliberations with respect to the motion pending before the Commission. Yours sincerely, Owen J. ROBERTS, Umpire [The German Commissioner to the American Commissioner] Deutsches Mitglied der Mixed Claims Commission 1439 Massachusetts Avenue, Washington, D. C. March 1, 1939 The German Commissioner Mixed Claims Commission Dear Colonel Garnett: Under even date I am sending a letter to Mr. Justice Roberts [p. 1707] in which I apprise him of my retirement from the post of German member of the Mixed Claims Commission. I know that this step comes at a moment when our deliberations are still in an absolutely preliminary state and at a time when any question of possible agreement</p>

<p>225 awards in accordance with the Agreement reached at Munich in July, 1936. The American Agent likewise filed with the Commission the several protests received on behalf of American nationals and on behalf of German nationals. The questions involved in these Motions and protests were discussed in briefs filed with the Commission, and were the subject of oral arguments before the Commission at the meeting held July, 7 1937, at which meeting the following rulings thereon by the Commission were announced by the Umpire:] " The Commission has considered the motion with care and has also consid- ered all of the points made in the briefs and oral argument. Without reiterating its reasons, it is of the opinion that the motion must be dismissed, unanimously of that opinion. " With regard to the protests by certain German nationals, those protests the Commission feels, in large part, fall as a result of its decision. The same thing is true of the protests by certain awardholders. " With regard to the applications filed by certain claimants, either German nationals or holders of claims under certain arbitral awards, and with regard to the applications of certain American awardholders to permit them to intervene in the proceedings, the Commission unanimously denies those applications."

<p>IV. Conclusions 454 Conclusion on the question of fraud restated 457 Decision of the Commission rendered by the Umpire 458 Certificate of Disagreement and Opinion of the American Commissioner These cases originated out of two disasters, — the first, the destruction at Black Tom, N. J., on July 29-30, 1916; the second, the fire at Kingsland, N. J., on January 11, 1917. In these disasters millions of dollars worth of property was destroyed, and in the case of Black Tom, at least two lives were lost. The Memorials of the United States were filed in March, 1927, and therefore the cases have been pending before the Commission more than twelve years. The present status of these claims is as follows: The American Agent on the 4th day of May, 1933, filed a petition for rehearing and reconsideration of the decision at Hamburg, dated the 16th day of October, 1930, on the ground that it was induced by fraud and collusion on the part of witnesses and suppres- sion of evidence on the part of some of them. The purpose of the petition is fully set out in the following language in the decision of the Umpire at Wash- ington, December 15, 1933 (Report of American Commissioner dated Decem- ber 30, 1933, pp. 75, 76): " Its allegations are that certain witnesses proffered by Germany furnished the Commission fraudulent, incomplete, collusive, and false evidence which misled the Commission and unfairly prejudiced the claimant's cases; that certain witnesses,</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>239 including some who previously testified, who are now within the United States, have knowledge and can give evidence which will convince the Commission that its decision was erroneous; that evidence has come to light showing collusion between certain German and American witnesses to defeat the claims. These are serious allegations, and I express no opinion of the adequacy of the evidence ten- dered by the American Agent to sustain them. I have refrained from examining the evidence because I thought it the proper course at this stage to decide the question of power on the assumption that the allegations of the petition may be supported by proof, postponing for the consideration of the Commission the probative value of the evidence tendered. " The petition, in short, avers the Commission has been misled by fraud and collusion on the part of witnesses and suppression of evidence on the part of some of them. The Commission is not Junetus ofpeio. It still sits as a court. To it in that capacity are brought charges that it has been defrauded and misled by perjury, collusion, and suppression. No tribunal worthy its name or of any respect may allow its decision to stand if such allegations are wellfounded. Every tribunal has inherent power to reopen and to revise a decision induced by fraud. If it may correct its own errors and mistakes, a fortiori it may, while it still has jurisdiction of a cause, correct errors into which it has been led by fraud and collusion. " I am of opinion, therefore, that the Commission has power to reopen these cases, and should do so, in order that it may consider the further evidence tendered by the American Agent and, dependent upon its findings from that evidence and any that may be offered in reply on behalf of Germany, either confirm the decisions heretofore made or alter them as justice and right may demand." On the 2nd day of May, 1935. the American Agent filed a Motion, asking that an Order be entered " to the effect that the Commission does not desire to take submission of these claims until all evidence that either Government desires to have considered in support of or in opposition to the pending petition for rehearing has been filed in order that the Commission may, when it takes submission, enter an Order finally disposing of these claims on their merits and that the Order further advise the Agents of the two Governments accordingly." The German Agent opposed the making of such an Order, and, in the decision of July 29, 1935, denying the Motion, the Commission, by the Umpire, said</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">( P - 2 ) :</h3>
<p>" By the petition and answer an issue was framed. This issue may be stated thus: ' Was the Commission misled by fraud practiced upon it? ' If that issue be decided in favor of the claimants, the Commission should reopen the case upon the merits and reexamine the conclusions reached in the light of the whole record, including the proofs offered to impeach evidence forming part of the record when its decision on the merits was rendered. Obviously the case is not reopened by the presentation of a petition praying for such action. Especially is this true where the allegations of the petition are categorically denied. This the American Agent concedes. The decision of November 4, 1934 \ so recognizes. It is there said: ' The issue which will come before the Commission is made up by the allegations of the petition and the categorical denials of the answer.' " In the course of his opinion the Umpire also said (p. 3): " * * * If the claimants prevail upon that preliminary question [the right to reopen]. the former decisions will be laid aside and the merits reexamined in the light of all the evidence, including that tendered on the issue of fraud and collusion. * * * " It is, of course, conceivable that the Commission should hear argument on both the propriety of reopening the case and the merits at one and the same time. Much may be said pro and con such a procedure. Nevertheless, I suppose that if the 1 Announced November 9, 1934.</p>
<p>240</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>parties were in agreement that this course should be followed, the Commission would acquiesce. There is no such agreement. Germany insists that the pre- liminary question be determined separately. I am of opinion this is her right. She now has a judgment. Before that judgment may be set aside and a new hearing held upon the merits, it is incumbent upon the claimants to sustain the affirmative of the issues made by their petition. The next hearing, therefore, will be upon the question of reopening vel non, and not upon the merits." Following this decision, additional evidence and exhaustive briefs were filed on behalf of each Government. Oral arguments were then had on May 12 to 29, 1936. The Commission on June 3, 1936, handed down a unanimous decision, setting aside the decision of December 3, 1932, and restoring the claims to the position they were in before that decision was rendered. In the course of its decision the Commission said: " Before the Hague Decision may be set aside the Commission must act upon the claimant's petition for rehearing. Whether upon the showing made, the Com- mission should grant a rehearing, unless Germany shall agree to a different course, must, under the Commission's decision of July 29, 1935, be determined by a hearing separate from and distinct from any argument on the merits." (Emphasis sup- plied.) That Germany, following the decision of June 3, 1936, did elect to follow " a different course ", is evidenced by the fact that the German Agent exercised the right given him in the Order of the Commission of December 1, 1937, reading as follows: " that the German Agent may not only file the documents called for under Rule 4 [of the Special Rules, under Order of March 20, 1929], b but may submit, if he desires, further evidence." The same Order provided that: " The German Agent shall file with the Commission any other evidence [in addition to that called for under Rule 4] he desires to file on or before March 1, 1938, and not thereafter." Pursuant to this Order, the German Agent did file a considerable amount of evidence other than that called for under Rule 4 of the Special Rules, his last evidence being filed on January 14, 1939. During the past twelve years, thousands of pages of evidence, consisting of official documents from the files of various Government Departments, affidavits, examinations of witnesses under the Act of July 3, 1930 (46 Stat. 1005), and under the act of June 7, 1933 (48 Stat. 117), and other instruments have been filed and during that period, voluminous briefs were filed by each side and lengthy oral arguments heard, covering the various features of the cases. The cases were closed on January 14, 1939, and each Agent has filed ex- haustive briefs covering a full discussion, not only of the questions raised by the petition of May 4, 1933, but likewise arguing the cases on the merits. The American Agent filed his briefs on September 13, and December 5, 1938. The German Agent filed his briefs on November 16, 1938, and January 12, and 14, 1939. After exhaustive oral arguments by distinguished counsel extending through twelve days, the cases were finally submitted to the Commission on the 27th day of January, 1939. After about two weeks had elapsed, the Umpire and the Commissioners began their conferences. These conferences continued, but not on consecutive days, until Tuesday, February 28, 1939, when the last conference was held. b Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 244 infra.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>241 Another conference was scheduled to be held on Thursday, March 2, 1939, at the office of the Umpire. Shortly before the time for the conference, a letter from the German Commissioner, announcing his retirement, was delivered to the Umpire and a similar letter was delivered to the American Commissioner. These letters and the replies thereto have been made matters of record. 1 The subject of these conferences, in their early stages, was whether the evi- dence which had been adduced had proven fraud sufficient in character to set aside the decision at Hamburg. In the course of these conferences, the American Commissioner expressed to the Umpire and to the German Commissioner his opinion that the decision at Hamburg had been reached on false and fraudulent evidence and that the proof of fraud was sufficient to set aside the Hamburg decision and reopen the cases. After the conferences had continued for a considerable time, the Umpire expressed himself in entire agreement with the American Commissioner on the question of fraud. Thereupon the German Commissioner argued that, if, upon an examination of the whole record, both before and subsequent to the Hamburg decision, the Commission were to come to the conclusion that the United States had not proven its case, even though there had been fraud in the evidence before The Hague argument, it would be necessary to dismiss the petition, and he urged upon the Umpire and the American Commissioner the necessity of considering the whole evidence for that purpose. It was thereupon agreed that the whole record should be examined to deter- mine whether the American case had been proven or not, and it was while the Commission was engaged in examining this question that the letters aforesaid of the German Commissioner were received. As was indicated clearly in the Umpire's reply, the letter to the Umpire presented a wholly false picture of the deliberations of the Commission. The effort of the German Commissioner to justify his retirement, by attributing bias to the Umpire, will receive, as it deserves, the disapprobation of every right- thinking person.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">CERTIFICATE OF DISAGREEMENT</h2>
<p>Under these circumstances, I deem it my duty as American Commissioner to certify, and I do hereby certify, to the Umpire that, in both of the cases now under consideration by the Commission, there was a disagreement between the American Commissioner and the German Commissioner on all material points before the Commission, and particularly on the point as to whether the evidence which has been adduced had established fraud sufficient in character to justify the Commission in setting aside the decision at Hamburg. I further certify that at the time when the German Commissioner retired, the Commission was, at his instance, considering the question whether the American Agent had proven his case, and, more particularly, whether the Herrmann message was an authentic instrument; and with this, my certificate, I am submitting my opinion with respect to said cases and the points of difference certified, and I respectfully ask that this opinion be filed as a part of the record in this case.</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">I. JURISDICTION</h3>
<p>There have been spread upon the minutes of the Commission the letter of the German Commissioner, addressed to the Umpire, announcing his retirement 1 For letters, see appendix. (Note by the Secretariat, this volume, Appendix V. p. 493.)</p>

<p>from the post of German Member of the Mixed Claims Commission; the Um- pire's reply thereto; the letter of the German Commissioner to the American Commissioner apprizing him of his retirement ; the American Commissioner's reply thereto, and the letter of the American Commissioner to the Secretary of State, notifying the Secretary of State of the German Commissioner's retire- ment and the status of this case at the time of the retirement of the German Commissioner. Although the German Commissioner announced his retirement on March 1, 1939, and more than three months has expired, the German Government has failed to follow the procedure prescribed by the Agreement of August 10, 1922, for filling the vacancy. Under the circumstances set out above and in the letters spread upon the minutes, the question which is now before the Commission for its decision is, whether the Commission, acting through the Umpire and the American Com- missioner, has the power to proceed with the cases and to decide whether the evidence which has been adduced has proven fraud sufficient in character to set aside the decision at Hamburg; and, second, whether upon an examination of the whole record, the American Agent has failed to prove his case. Or, to put the question in a different form, did the retirement of the German Commissioner on March, 1 1939, render the Commission functus qfficio and deprive the Commission of the power to decide the questions at issue? In order to examine and decide this question, it is necessary to refer to the pertinent provisions of the Treaty of Berlin; the Agreement of August 10, 1922, between the two Governments, under which this Commission was organized, and the Rules of Procedure adopted by the Commission. Under the Treaty of Berlin it was provided, in section 5, of the Joint Reso- lution of Congress, approved by the President July 2, 1921, 1 and incorporated in said Treaty, as follows: " All property of the Imperial German Government, or its successor or succes- sors, and of all German nationals, which was, on April 6, 1917, in or has since that date come into the possession or under control of, or has been the subject of a demand by the United States of America or of any of its officers, agents, or employees, from any source or by any agency whatsoever, * * * shall be retained by the United States of America and no disposition thereof made, except as shall have been heretofore or specifically hereafter shall be provided by law until such time as the Imperial German Government * * * shall have * * * made suitable provision for the satisfaction of all claims against said Governments respectively, of all persons, wheresoever domiciled, who owe perma- nent allegiance to the United States of America and who have suffered, through the acts of the Imperial German Government, or its agents, * * * since July 31, 1914, loss, damage, or injury to their persons or property, directly or indirectly, * * * or in consequence of hostilities or of any operations of war, or otherwise." Under the Agreement of August 10, 1922, between the United States and Germany, the preamble states that the two Governments, " being desirous of determining the amount to be paid by Germany in satisfaction of Germany's financial obligations under the Treaty concluded by the two Govern- ments on August 25, 1921, * * * have resolved to submit the questions for decision to a mixed commission." Article II of said Agreement reads as follows: " The Government of the United States and the Government of Germany shall each appoint one commissioner. The two Governments shall by agreement select 1 42 Stat. 105.</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">DÉCISIONS</h3>
<p>243 an umpire to decide upon any cases concerning which the commissioners may disagree, or upon any points of difference that may arise in the course of their proceedings. Should the umpire or any of the commissioners die or retire, or be unable for any reason to discharge his functions, the same procedure shall be followed for filling the vacancy as was followed in appointing him." Under this Agreement, the Mixed Claims Commission, United States and Germany, was constituted and was authorized to pass upon three categories of claims set out in said Agreement, and has decided many cases involving millions of dollars. The purpose for which the Commission was created is to determine the amount to be paid by Germany in satisfaction of Germany's obligations under the Treaty of Berlin to satisfy all claims against Germany of all persons who owe permanent allegiance to the United States and who have suffered through the acts of the Imperial German Government, or its agents, loss, damage, or injury to their persons or property, directly or indirectly. As indicated above, the German Commissioner retired on March 1, 1939, and although more than three months have expired, Germany has not followed the procedure provided by the Agreement of August 10, 1922, for filling the vacancy. Article VI of the Agreement of August 10, 1922, contains the following: " The decisions of the commission and those of the umpire (in case there may be any) shall be accepted as final and binding upon the two Governments." Article VI (d) of the Rules of Procedure reads as follows : " (d) When a case is submitted in pursuance of the foregoing provisions, the proceedings before the Commission in that case shall be deemed closed, unless opened by order of the Commission." Article VIII, of the Rules of Procedure adopted by the Commission, reads as follows:</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">" DECISIONS</h2>
<p>" (a) The two National Commissioners will certify in writing to the Umpire for decision f 1) any case or cases concerning which the Commissioners may disagree, or (2) any point or points of difference that may arise in the course of their proceed- ings, accompanied or supplemented by any statement in writing which either of them may desire to make of his opinion with respect to the decision of the case or cases or point or points of difference certified. " (b) The Umpire shall at all times have the right to the complete record in any and all cases and to hear oral argument in his discretion. " (c) The Umpire may join with the two National Commissioners in announcing — or in the event of their disagreement certified to him shall announce — principles and rules of decision applicable to a group or groups of cases for the guidance as far as applicable of the American Agent, the German Agent, and their respective counsel, in the preparation and presentation of all claims. " (d) All decisions shall be in writing and signed by (1) the Umpire and the two National Commissioners, or (2) by the two National Commissioners where they are in agreement, or (3) by the Umpire alone when the two National Com- missioners have certified their disagreement to him. Such decisions need not state the grounds upon which they are based." On March 20, 1929, the Commission entered an Order providing additional rules governing the sabotage cases, reading as follows (Report of the American Agent, 1934, p. 177): " IT IS ORDERED BY THE COMMISSION that special additional rules applicable to this group of ' sabotage cases ' are adopted as follows:</p>
<p>244</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMAN Y</h3>
<p>" (1) The Umpire will sit with the National Commissioners throughout the argument. " (2) Each member of the Commission will carefully consider the entire record and the points and arguments put forward in the briefs whether the Agents and counsel refer thereto in their oral arguments or not. This will enable counsel for both sides to confine their arguments to those points which they believe to be most essential without incurring the risk of waiving a point not mentioned on the oral argument but considered relevant by any member of the Commission. " (3) If any member of the Commission considers a point not orally argued one which should be taken into account in the Commission's decision, counsel's attention will be called thereto during the progress of the argument or subsequent thereto, and counsel for both parties will be given an opportunity to discuss same on the oral argument or to file written or printed briefs within a time to be fixed by the Commission covering such particular point or points. " (4) Where either party has for lack of time or other reason (other than a lack of diligence by such party) failed to produce evidence in rebuttal of that filed by the other party, and in the opinion of any member of the Commission such evidence in rebuttal is material; or where in the opinion of any member of the Commission further evidence on any point should be presented to aid the Commission in reaching a sound decision, the Commission will, within the time to be fixed by it, give the party or parties an opportunity to prepare and file such additional evidence. Where such additional evidence is not strictly in rebuttal the adverse party will be given a reasonable opportunity, within a time to be fixed by the Commission, to file evidence in rebuttal thereof. " (5) Where, under orders of the Commission, evidence is filed during the progress of the oral argument or subsequent thereto, both parties will be given an opportunity, within a time to be fixed by the Commission, for the filing of written or printed supplementary briefs dealing with the evidence so filed." Ever since these additional rules were adopted, the Commission has func- tioned in the sabotage cases as an arbitration body with three members, and the Umpire has sat with the two National Commissioners at each hearing, both during the examination of witnesses and the argument of counsel and has participated in the opinions. By the very terms of the Agreement of August 10, 1922, and by the express terms of Article VIII of the Rules of Procedure, " any cases concerning which the Commissioners may disagree " and " any points of difference " may be decided by the concurrence of the two Commissioners, or by the concurrence of the Umpire and one National Commissioner. Thus it appears that, under the organic law by which the Commission was created, and under its own Rules of Procedure, unanimity is not required, and the concurrence of only two is necessary for a decision, and this has been the practice ever since the Commission started functioning. After the Hamburg decision was announced, that decision was attacked by the American Agent on the ground that it was irregularly rendered, because the Umpire participated in the deliberations of the National Commissioners and in the opinion of the Commission. On March 30, 1931, the Commission, in a unanimous opinion, answered this ground of attack as follows : " This question is raised by the American Agent's claim that the decision was irregularly rendered because the Umpire participated in the deliberations of the National Commissioners and in the opinion of the Commission. The Umpire participated in the deliberations of the Commissioners and in the opinion in accordance with the usual practice of the Commission in cases of importance since its foundation in 1922, a practice never before questioned and not in our judgment of doubtful validity even if it had not so long been accepted by all concerned."</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>245 Thus, both before the special additional rules were adopted and after they were adopted, the Umpire has participated in the deliberations of the Commis- sioners and in the opinions of the Commission. Under the organic law governing the procedure of the Commission, that is to say, the Treaty of Berlin, the Agreement of August 10, 1922, and the Rules of Procedure adopted by the Commission, and under the practice which has obtained, since the Commission was established, is it possible, after a case has been submitted to the Commission and the two National Commissioners are in disagreement as to the direct issue before the Commission, for one National Commissioner to retire and prevent a decision by the remaining members of the Commission? If it be possible for one National Commissioner, whether under the express order or with the tacit consent of his Government, thus to bring to naught and render worthless the work resulting from the expenditure of thousands of dollars and years of careful research, and thus to defeat the very purpose for which the Commission was constituted under the Treaty of Berlin, such a result would make a mockery of international arbitration. A somewhat similar case is the case of Republic of Colombia v. Cauca (1903), 190 U.S. 524 (modifying and affirming s.c, 113 Fed. 1020; s. c. 106 Fed. 337). In that case the Republic of Colombia brought a suit in equity in the Circuit Court for the District of West Virginia against the Cauca Company and the Colombian Construction and Improvement Company, two corporations organized under the laws of the State of West Virginia. The purpose of the bill was to obtain a decree canceling an award made by two of three arbitrators, acting under an agreement of arbitration between the Republic of Colombia and the Cauca Company in connection with a contract for the construction of the Cauca Railway. The award was signed by two of the three arbitrators and was in favor of the Cauca Company for a large sum of money. One of the grounds for claiming that the award was invalid was because it was signed by only two of the three arbitrators. It was alleged in the bill of complaint (U.S.S.C. Transcripts of Record, p. 28165) as follows: " That in and by such Agreement [of Arbitration] it was provided in Article 6, that should any of the members of the commission decline to act or resign from the commission or for any reason cease to act, the proceedings of the commission should not thereby be invalidated, but the commission should be restored by a new appointment which was to be made, by the party who appointed the member who failed to act, within thirty days, counting from the date on which said failure to act should occur. If such party should not comply with such obligation, the Secretary of State of the United States of America and the Minister of Colombia at Washington should proceed by agreement to appoint a person to fill the vacancy." It was further alleged that, after the Commissioners were duly appointed, they held thirty-four sessions, and at the 35th session " the Commission was notified by Manuel H. Pena, the Commissioner named by the Minister of the Treasury of complainant, that he had resigned to the said Minister of the Trea- sury who had appointed him, the office of Commissioner, and he transmitted to the other commissioners, through its secretary, a copy of his letter of resig- nation addressed to the said minister; that the said resignation was the indepen- dent act of the said commissioner — not done by the order of, or with the know- ledge of the complainant, the Republic of Colombia, which only had knowledge of it after the resignation, which was to take effect from its date, was actually transmitted to the Minister of the Treasury of this complainant." 17</p>
<p>246</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>It was further alleged that no request had been made by the defendant or either member of the commission or the complainant, or any member of its government, or its representative in the United States, to restore the commission by filling the vacancy; that notwithstanding the voluntary retirement and resignation of Pena, the remaining members, without any notice to the com- plainant or anyone representing it, and without request or opportunity for restoring the commission by the appointment of a third member, but immediat- ely, on the same day that said Pena resigned, assembled together and assumed to continue the functions of said commission in the absence of Pena, and finally formulated a pretended decision or award; that the commission, after the retirement and resignation of Pena, was wholly incompetent in law to proceed further or to make any decision or award, or to do any other matter until the commission had been restored in accordance with Article six of the agreement under which the commission existed, that is to say, by the appointment by the complainant of another person in his place and stead. It was further alleged that the two remaining members of the commission, in disregard of their duty of fairness and impattiality, misconducted themselves in the last two sessions; that one of the arbitrators was guilty of misconduct as an arbitrator; that the two commissioners received wholly incompetent evidence. One of the prayers was, that the pretended award promulgated by the two commissioners might be decreed to be utterly null and void and of no effect. Honorable Nathan B. Goff, Judge of the United States Circuit Court of the District of West Virginia, heard the case and wrote the opinion. After stating the facts upon which the suit was founded, he described the terms of the agree- ment by which the arbitration was effected (106 Fed. 337, 342). He then described the organization of the commission and stated (106 Fed. 343) : " The Commission decided at its second meeting * * • that all of its decisions should be by majority vote of the members, and at its third session it was resolved that, in case of disagreement between the members of the Commission, the chair- man should decide the question at issue." In summarizing the action taken by the sessions of the commission, Judge Goff says (106 Fed. 344): " At its thirtieth session, * * * the Commission commenced the considera- tion of the testimony — oral arguments and briefs of counsel having been made and filed — for the purpose of formulating its award." Then follows a description of the awards in certain sums for different pur- poses. And then Judge Goff states (106 Fed. 344): " At the meeting of the Commission held on October 19, 1897, it was moved to- award the company as interest on the cost of physical construction to January 26, 1897, the sum of $48,668.18, and the questions relating thereto were discussed, but the vote thereon was postponed. * * * The meeting was the thirty- fourth of the Commission, and all the members of the same were present, as they had been at all previous meetings; all the members had heard the testimony and the arguments, and all had taken part in the discussion and deliberations relating thereto, * * * " At the thirty-fifth session, Pena did not appear, but he caused to be presented his letter of resignation. In his letter to the Minister of the Republic of Colom- bia he based his determination to resign upon the declared intention of the other two members of the Commission to allow the Cauca Company large amounts for the alleged expenditures having no relation to either construction</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>247 expenses or the purchase of material, and, therefore, Pena claimed that the Commission had no jurisdiction to pass upon or allow such expenditures; and, further, that the Commissioners had departed from the terms of the convention and proposed to act wholly beyond their official powers. Therefore he expres- sed his intention to refuse to act further as a commissioner and to decline to remain a member of the Commission until the illegal intentions of the Com- mission should have been carried out (106 Fed. 345). The two remaining Commissioners met and passed a resolution setting out a short history of the resignation of Pena and the failure of the Republic of Columbia to appoint a successor, then it was resolved that the Commission should proceed forthwith to make its award and formulate its decision as to the matters involved in the convention. After setting out the above facts, Judge Goff formulated the question involved in the following language (106 Fed. 347): " Is the award defective because only signed by two of the three arbitrators? " In discussing this question it was held that a unanimous decision was not required in express words, and that in a case of this character it should not be implied, and that, if Pena had not tendered his resignation and had he been present at the session when the award was made and had he then entered his dissent, still the award would have been binding on the parties unless some other good cause could have been shown to render it void. Then Judge Goff said (p. 348): " In addition to this, I think that the submission was in the nature of a public contention; that the compromise and adjustment of the same through the medium of the commissioners was based on a public law, — an act of the congress of the republic of Colombia; and that, therefore, under the well-established rule applicable to such controversies, the decision of the majority will conclude the minority, and their act will be the judgment of the whole number appointed. The dispute was, at least, brought to an issue by an act of the congress of the republic of Colombia, by which the franchise of the railway claimed by the Cauca Company was in effect forfeited. The submission was evidently the result of the friendly suggestions emanating from the secretary of state of the United States, and conveyed to the government of the republic of Colombia through the minister of the United States residing at Bogota. The third member of the commission was chosen, not by the parties nor by the commissioners appointed by them, but by the representatives of the governments of the republic of Colombia and of the United States. The original concession to Cherry recognized the enterprise he was authorized to carry out to be of public utility, and conceded to him all the rights usual under such circumstances. In such cases, unless there is a special provision to the contrary, unanimity in reaching a decision is not required of the commissioners. Co. Litt. 181a; Grindley v. Barker, 1 Bos. &amp; P. 236; Ex parte Rogers, 7 Cow. 526." In later discussing the question as to whether there really was a vacancy or not, Judge Goff said (p. 348): " Clearly, it was not the intention of the parties to the convention that the existence of the commission should be destroyed by a resignation of the character of that presented by Commissioner Pena. It would be an impeachment of the common honesty of the parties to the agreement, and a travesty on their evidently honorable intentions, to hold that they designed it should thus be in the power of one man — actuated by, to say the least, not commendable motives — to render worthless the work resulting from the expenditure of thousands of dollars and months of careful research, in an effort to amicably adjust an unfortunate controversy, that was rapidly reaching the point of embarrassment because of its national and diplomatic character. The testimony forces me to the conclusion that Commissioner Pena's only motive in withdrawing from the Commission was to prevent, if possible, a conclusion from being reached, or to render the award invalid should one be</p>
<p>248</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>made. This conduct — keeping in view all the circumstances surrounding him and the commission of which he was still a member — was not only reprehensible in character, but was fraudulent in its tendencies." As in the Cauca Case, so in the sabotage cases, one is impelled to the conclusion that the German Commissioner's only motive for retiring from the Commission was to prevent, if possible, a conclusion from being reached, or to render the award invalid should one be made. This case was carried to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and in a per curiam decision, that Court said (113 Fed. 1020) : " We have carefully considered the opinion of the Circuit Court, the subject matter of appeal in these two cases. We can add nothing to the clear statement of the facts of the case made by the learned judge who delivered the opinion of the court (106 Fed. 337), and we can add nothing to the reasons which led him to his conclusion, in which conclusion we entirely concur. The decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed." When the case came before the Supreme Court of the United States (190 U.S. 524), that Court reversed the case as to the amount of the award that had been granted but affirmed it in other respects. The decision of the Court on the question as to the necessity of a unanimous vote is set out in the second syllabus, as follows: " Where the parties to a controversy have submitted the matter to a commission of three who have the power to, and do resolve that all decisions shall be by majority vote, an award by a majority is sufficient and effective." The decision on the question of the power of one party to an arbitration or dispute to defeat the operation of the submission after receiving benefits there- under by withdrawing, or by adopting the withdrawal of its nominee, is thus stated in the third syllabus of the case: " In an arbitration between a sovereign State and a railroad company and affecting public concerns, whatever might be the technical rules for arbitrators dealing with a private dispute, neither party can defeat the operation of the submission after receiving benefits thereunder, by withdrawing, or by adopting the withdrawal of its nominee, after the discussions have been closed." Mr. Justice Holmes, after stating the facts leading up to the arbitration agree- ment, related the terms of the arbitration agreement and discussed the effect of the resignation of one of the arbitrators as follows: " The essential features of the agreement were that the company by the second article surrendered the railroad, and that Colombia agreed to pay a just indemnity, the scope of which will be considered later, and which was to be determined by the commission. The commission consisted of three — one appointed on behalf of Colombia, one on behalf of the company and the third by agreement between the Secretary of State of this country and the Colombian Minister at Washington. The Commission, spoken of in the agreement in the singular, was to ' determine the procedure to be followed in the exercise of the power conferred upon it, both as to its own acts and as to the proceedings of the parties'. In pursuance of this power it resolved that all decisions should be by majority vote. Thereafter the casewas tried, and several items were allowed to the company which it was contended by the representatives of Colombia were not within the scope of the submission. At the end of the trial, when hardly anything remained to be done except to sign the award, the questions remaining open concerning only matters of interest which have been disallowed, the Colombian commissioner announced his resignation to the commission. " The agreement gave Colombia thirty days to appoint a new member, and on its failure the Secretary of State for the United States and the Colombian Minister were to appoint him. But the Commission was allowed only one hundred and fifty</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>249 days ' from its installation,' which might be extended sixty days more for justifiable grounds. It had sat two hundred and three days when the resignation was announ- ced. Manifestly it was possible, if not certain, that its only way of saving the proceedings from coming to naught was to ignore the communication and to proceed to the award. This it did. Colombia by its bill and argument now lays hold of the resignation of its commissioner as a ground for declaring the award void. " Colombia thus is put in the position of seeking to defeat the award after it has received the railroad in controversy and while it is undisputed that an appre- ciable part of the consideration awarded ought to be paid to the company under the terms of the submission. It is fair to add that the bill offers to pay the undis- puted sum, but not to rescind the submission and return the railroad. We shall spend little argument upon this part of the case. Of course, it was not expected that a commission made up as this was would be unanimous. The commission was dealt with as a unit, as a kind of court, in the submission. It was constituted after, if not as the result of, diplomatic discussion in pursuance of a public statute of Colombia. It was to decide between a sovereign State and a railroad, declared by a law of Colombia to be a work of public utility. In short, it was dealing with matters of public concern. It had itself resolved, under the powers given to it in the agreement, that a majority vote should govern. Obviously that was the only possible way, as each party appointed a representative of its side. We are satisfied that an award by a majority was sufficient and effective. We are satisfied, further, that whatever might be the technical rule for three arbitrators dealing with a private dispute, neither party could defeat the operation of the submission, after receiving a large amount of property under it, by withdrawing or adopting the withdrawal of its nominee when the discussions were closed. See Cooleyv. O'Connor, 12 Wall. 391, 398; Kings/on v. Kincaid, 1 Wash. C. C. 448; Exporte Rogers, 1 Cowen, 526; Carpenter v. Wood, 1 Met. 409; Maynard v. Frederick, 7 Cush. 247; Kunckle v. Kunckle, 1 Dall. 364; Cumberland v. North Yarmouth, 4 Greenl. 459, 468; Grindley v. Barker, 1 Bos. &amp; P. 229, 236; Dalling v. Matchett, Willes, 215, 217. In private matters the courts are open if arbitration fails, but in this case the alternative was a resort to diplomatic demand." As has already been shown in this opinion, it was not contemplated by the organic law under which this Commission has operated that the decisions should be unanimous. On the contrary, it is perfectly apparent that in no case has it been necessary to have the concurrence of more than two members of the Commission. It is also perfectly clear that the United States was under no obligation whatever to return the property which had been seized, but in a spirit of generosity it provided in the Treaty of Berlin that this property should be held as collateral security to pay the claims of American nationals who had suffered loss in persons or property at the hands of the German Government or its agents. Cummings v. Deutsche Bank, 300 U.S. 115, 122-125; United States v. While Dental Co., 274 U.S. 398. Under the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 (45 Stat, 254-279), 80% of the German enemy property at that time remaining was immediately returned to its former owners. The German Government, therefore, is in no position to contend that the act of its Commissioner in resigning can have the effect of preventing the remaining members of the Commission from passing upon the questions at issue when he retired. The case of Colombia v. Cauca Co. again came before the Supreme Court of the United States in 195 U.S. 604, where it was held that nothing in the former decree prohibited the Circuit Court from allowing interest on the amount of the items allowed. In the last case (195 U.S. 604), the Court again affirmed its action in modifying the action of the Circuit Court only in respect to the amount allowed. In Atchison, T. &amp;• S. F. Ry. Co. v. Brotherhood of L. F. and E., 26 Fed. (2d), 413, there was an arbitration under the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C.A., sees. 151-163). It was held by the Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit,</p>
<p>250</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>that an award by a majority of the members of an arbitration board appointed pursuant to provisions of the act, before expiration of time provided in agree- ment for entering an award, was valid, notwithstanding the refusal of certain members to participate therein, on the ground that the board had previously filed a report showing an inability to reach an agreement. In reaching its decision, Evans, Circuit Judge, laid down the following proposition (p. 417): " Equally well settled is the rule that one arbitrator or a minority of arbitrators cannot, after the dispute has been fully submitted to the Board, defeat an award by resigning, withdrawing, or otherwise refusing to participate in the hearings. Colombia v. Cauca Co., supra. Such a resignation or withdrawal shortly before the time fixed for the expiration of the arbitration, constitutes a fraud and, as such, defeats its purpose." Text writers on international law seem to approve the principle of the Cauca Case, which was followed in the case last cited, namely, that one arbitrator, or a minority of arbitrators, cannot, after the dispute has been fully submitted, defeat an award by withdrawal or by adopting the withdrawal of its nominee, or by otherwise refusing to participate in the hearings after the discussions have been closed. Witenberg, L'Organisation Judiciaire, la Procédure et la Sentence Internationales, 1937, states the rule thus: " 24. In the calculation of majority all members of the tribunal must be counted, including those who might refuse to take part in the voting. These latter must be considered as having voted against the decision of the majority of the judges present and a report of their refusal shall be drawn up." (p. 281) (Translation from the French.) Mérignhac has the following to say in his Traité Théorique et Pratique de L'Arbitrage International (pp. 276-77) : " If one or more of the arbitrators refuse to take part in the deliberations, M. Calvo feels that they should be replaced: and in case this is impossible the tribunal should be dissolved. The Institute of International Law has decided with sound reason in Article 21 1 of its rules that the majority suffices for judgment in the hypothesis we have spoken of. It is, in effect, impossible to admit that one arbiter by bad faith, perversity, or simple negligence can paralyze the action of the tribunal." Calvo, to whom Mérignhac refers, has said: " When the arbitral tribunal is composed of several members certain publicists are of the opinion that the absence of one of them prevents all valuable deliberation and decision even though the other arbitrators would form the majority and would agree, for the reason that the missing member might modify the decision of the others by the exposition of his own opinion. " However Sir Robert Phillimore takes the view that if the absence of one of them is intentional or the result of intrigue the other members have the power to continue the procedure. As far as we are concerned we think that in such a case the proof being made of the unwillingness of the missing member it would be necessary to replace him or otherwise dissolve the arbitral tribunal as would be done in the case of the death of one the members unless special provisions are prescribed in the original compromis for such eventuality." (Sec. 768, Le Droit International Théorique et Pratique, Vol. Ill, 5th edition, Charles Calvo, Argentine). 1 Article 21 is as follows: " Every final or provisional decision shall be made by a majority of all the arbitrators named, even when one or more of the arbitrators refuse to take part therein."</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>251 Whether Calvo would apply this rule in a case like the instant case, where the presentation of testimony had been closed, briefs filed and arguments completed, may be doubtful; but in any event his views appear not to have the support of the other text writers. Sir Robert Phillimore, to whom Calvo refers, says: " If there be an uneven number of arbitrators the opinion of the majority would, according to the reason of the thing and the Jus communa of nations be conclusive. If one of the arbitrators were maliciously to absent himself it might be competent for the others to proceed; but if one were dead, the arbitration would be dissolved, unless provision had been made for the contingency in the original covenant." (Commentaries upon International Law, London, Vol. Ill, p. 4). In commercial arbitration cases the trend of authorities seems to be in accord with the rule laid down in the Republic of Colombia v. Cauca, 190 U.S. 524, and followed in the case of Atchison, T. &amp;• S. F. Ry. Co. v. Brotherhood of L. F. and E., 26 Fed. (2d) 413. See Burtlet v. Smith, 94 Eng. Rep. 587 (King's Bench); Dalling v.

See also 6 Corpus Juris Secundum, p. 206. As we have already seen, these cases have been pending for more than twelve years. Thousands of pages of evidence, consisting of original documents from the files of the various government departments, affidavits, examinations of witnesses, and other instruments have been filed during that period ; large sums of money have been spent in procuring this evidence and producing it before the Commission. It has been an enormous work, involving labor of many persons — experts, technicians and lawyers. The cases have been argued before the Commission on six different occasions by eminent counsel. Learned and exhaustive briefs have been filed, entailing great labor on the part of those who composed them; and every phase of the case has been fully dis- cussed, both in written briefs and orally. The oral arguments have consumed a period of about sixty days. On the pending petition, the cases were closed for filing of evidence and briefs on January 14, 1939. After exhaustive oral arguments by distinguished counsel, extending through twelve days, the cases were finally submitted to the Commission on the 27th day of January, 1939. After about two weeks had elapsed, the Um-</p>

<p>pire and the Commissioners began their conferences. These conferences continued, but not on consecutive days, until Tuesday, February 28, 1939, when the last conference with the German Commissioner was held. Another conference was scheduled to be held on Thursday, March 2, 1939, at the office of the Umpire. Shortly before the time for the conference, the letters of the German Commissioner announcing his retirement were delivered to the Umpire and the American Commissioner, respectively. 1 As is clearly indicated by the letter which was written by the American Commissioner to the Secretary of State, the American Commissioner and the German Commissioner were in direct disagreement as to the issues before the Commission, that is to say, as to whether the record established fraud of a sufficient character to set aside the decision at Hamburg, and, at the instance of the German Commissioner, the Commission was examining the record to determine whether the American Agent had proven his case, and specifically whether the Herrmann message was genuine, when the German Commissioner announced his retirement. Under the circumstances set out above, to hold that one National Com- missioner could, by his voluntary retirement, whether authorized by his Government or not, prevent the Commission from further proceeding with the cases, and especially from deciding the questions at issue when the German Commissioner announced his retirement, would defeat the purpose of the two Governments in establishing this Commission, would deprive the American Nationals in these cases of the remedy provided by the Treaty of Berlin and the Agreement of August 10, 1922, for American Nationals with claims against the German Government recognized by that treaty, and would raise many questions difficult of solution, as to the disposition of the funds now remaining in the Treasury of the United States, pursuant to the Settlement of War Claims Act. Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the retirement of the German Commis- sioner on March 1, 1939, did not render the Commission functus qfficio and did not deprive the Commission of the power to decide the questions at issue at the time of his retirement. Since the above opinion on jurisdiction was prepared, the American Com- missioner has been furnished with a copy of a translation of a note from the German Embassy to the Secretary of State dated June 10, 1939,2 in which the German Embassy notifies the Secretary of State that, since the withdrawal of the German Commissioner, the Commission has been incompetent to make decisions, and there is no legal basis for a meeting of the Commission at this stage, and that the German Government " will ignore the decision to call the meeting of the Commission on June 15th, as well as any other act of the Com- mission that might take place in violation of the International Agreement of August 10, 1922 and the generally established rules of procedure ". The possibility that the German Government would take this position was taken into consideration in writing this opinion, and this action on the part of the German Government strengthens the decision already reached, to-wit, that the retirement of the German Commissioner on March 1, 1939, did not render the Commission functus qfficio and did not deprive the Commission of the power to decide the questions at issue at the time of his retirement. 1 For letters, see Appendix, (Note by the Secretariat, this volume, Appendix V, p. 493.) 2 For note, see Appendix.

<h3 class="doc-h3">II. FRAUD</h3>
<p>The questions involved under the issue of fraud may be examined under three heads. First, were the pleadings filed by Germany, in answer to the Memorial filed by the United States, false and fraudulent; and, if so, who participated in such fraud and what was its effect in the decision at Hamburg, October 16, 1930? Second, was the evidence adduced to substantiate the pleadings false and fraudulent; and if so, who participated in such fraud and what was its effect in the decision at Hamburg, October 16, 1930? Third, have the counsel who represented Germany made fraudulent mis- representations to the Commission or suppressed evidence unfavorable to Germany; and if so, how far has this conduct affected the decision in this case? While it is perfectly patent that the decision at Hamburg cannot be set aside on account of fraud in the pleadings alone, the question of fraud permeates both the pleadings and the evidence and the conduct of counsel, and it is logically, and chronologically, proper to examine the question of fraud in the pleadings first. A. Fraud in The Pleadings The Memorials filed by the United States charged in substance that, im- mediately after the outbreak of the European war, Germany ordered and conducted throughout the world a general campaign for the destruction of war supplies in neutral countries, and that this campaign of sabotage in neutral countries for the destruction of war supplies, particularly munitions, was ex- tended to the United States while the United States was at peace with Germany. The Memorials further charged that the destructions at Black Tom and Kings- land were the result of sabotage by German agents. In the Answers of Germany, filed December 14, 1927, in the Black Tom case, and January 17, 1928, in the Kingsland case, it was denied that, immedi- ately after the outbreak of the European war, Germany ordered and conducted throughout the world a general campaign for the destruction of war supplies in neutral countries; and it was specifically denied that the campaign of sabo- tage in neutral countries was ever extended to the United States. (See Section III, p. 2 and Section IV, p. 9 of each Answer of Germany.) In her Answers, Germany admitted that she conducted expeditions against Canada, and these expeditions were initiated from the United States, but alleged that such acts had no relation to the charge made against Germany in this case; that the acts were directed exclusively against enemy property and were not intended to do harm to American property. (See Section IV, par 12 of each Answer.) Germany denounced as a fabrication an alleged circular, authorizing sabo- tage in neutral countries, and, as a further fabrication, an alleged order, expressly extending the operation of the circular to the United States; and, in making this denial, the Answers use the following language: " In this connection the German Agent declares again that he is authorized to state on behalf of his Government that no such order was ever issued by any department or agency of his Government." (Section IV, par. 13) The United States had cited an intercepted cablegram or message from the General Staff dated January 26, 1915, addressed to the Military Attaché in Washington (Ex. 320, Rec. p. 802). This message as sent from Berlin on January 25, 1915, to Washington via Stockholm, reads, in the translation furnished by the German Agent, as follows :</p>

<p>Division 11 It To the No. Pol. 205. F o r e i g n Office Secret : Berlin. — With reference to A. S. 56 of the 23rd inst. It is respectfully requested to have dispatched the following telegram in cipher to the Imperial Embassy at Washington: [For Military Attaché: People fit for sabotage in United States and Canada can be ascertained from following persons: 1) Joseph Mac Garrity, 5412 Springfield Philadelphia, Pa., 2) John P. Keating, Maryland Avenue Chicago, 3) Jeremia O'Leary, Park Row, New York. No. 1 and 2 absolutely reliable and discreet, No. 3 reliable not always discreet. Persons have been named by Sir Roger Casement. In United States sabotage can reach to all kinds of factories for war deliveries; railroads, dams, bridges must not be touched there. Under no circumstances compromise Embassy, and equally Irish-German propaganda. Acting General Staff"] (In the name of the Under secretary of State In mundo)." (Ger. Ex. XXXIV, a and b) In its Answers, Germany admitted that this message was genuine, that it had been sent by the Intelligence Division of the General Staff, and had been received by the Military Attaché at Washington, Captain von Papen. The Answers refer to exhibits filed therewith by Messrs. Nadolny, von Papen. von Igel and Count Bernstorff, and then allege as follows : " These statements show that the sending of the message was the act of a sub- ordinate division of the General Staff; that the suggestions made therein were entirely disregarded by von Papen; that the Message remained in the files of the latter and that no action whatsoever was ever taken upon it ; that no other suggestions of this kind were even given by the General Staff, that the whole event is but the blunder of a subordinate and that the incident had no consequences whatsoever." [Emphasis supplied.] (Sec. IV, par. 14 of each Answer.) Exhibit G filed with the Answers, is an affidavit of von Papen, who was Military Attaché to the Embassy in Washington and to the German Legation in Mexico at the outbreak of the World War, and who continued as Military Attaché in Washington until he was recalled at the instance of the United States Government. In this instrument he denied that he had ever in any way given any suggestions, instructions, orders or authorizations for destroying factories and stores of munitions within the United States, and that he had lent his support to or furthered any projects aiming at such destruction. He further stated (p. 5) : " I also never received orders or instructions to commit acts of force against American munitions factories or stores of munitions, from central military authori- ties or other superiors. I did, however, receive one authorization for undertaking such acts, which I shall treat separately."</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>255 He denied having received the alleged circular of the General Staff author- izing sabotage or the letter in regard to said circular giving effect to such circular on American territory. With reference to the message of January 26, 1915, he stated as follows (p. 6) : " I persisted in my opposition to sabotage acts, even when I received the tele- gram dated Jan. 26, 1915 (Exhibit 18 and Exhibit 320, page 35), in which the Department III-B of the Home General Staff declared sabotage on the territory of the United States to be permitted, at the same time giving addresses where information for this purpose might be obtained. From the very first I was of the opinion that it would be an indefensible decision to make use of this telegram. I did not impute to it any great significance because I was convinced that it did not spring from the initiative of a German military authority but was due to the urging of Sir Roger Casement who had, in the United States given vent to similar projects. To this was added the fact that it was not an utterance of a leading military authority, who alone could have dispatched such important questions and instruction binding for me, but instead was a communication of a subordinate department of the Home General Staff. Therefore, I did not, even in passing, consider acting on the telegram but for the reasons stated above simply considered it as requiring no further action. I expressed myself to the same effect to Mr. von Igel. Furthermore, it is my distinct recollection that I did not talk to the Ambassador. There was no necessity for that because I did not receive definite instructions for undertaking sabotage, it being left entirely to my discretion whether to initiate such acts." In his affidavit, von Papen specifically disapproved of von Rintelen's acti- vities and those of Dr. Scheele in the manufacture of bombs. Exhibit B, filed with the Answers, is a statement of Nadolny. In this state- ment, Nadolny, the Chief of " Sektion Politik " of the General Staff, alleged that reports were coming to his office " that America was not taking a neutral attitude but was opposing Germany especially by way of effectively supporting our opponents with war materials "; that persons were coming from America who advised taking steps against American factories engaged in supplying enemies with war materials and who named to the Political Section people " who could in many possible ways frustrate such production by acts of sabotage." Then the Chief of the " Sektion Politik " stated as follows: " Following this advice, we in fact once sent such instruction to Washington at the beginning of 1915, if I remember it correctly. It was, however, especially pointed out therein that acts of sabotage were only to be directed against the delivery of war materials and not against any other objects. " However, the Foreign Office took the position that even sabotage of that kind was not permissible as America, in spite of its war support which was contrary to the spirit of neutrality, was officially a neutral country. For that reason — as far as I know — no further instructions were sent out. As I learned later on, the first order was not carried out either, because the Authorities in Washington also opposed the execution and did not take any steps." (Emphasis supplied.) Germany filed as German Exhibit XXXV, an affidavit of the same man, Rudolph Nadolny. In this exhibit, Nadolny claimed that the telegram of January 26, 1915, originated out of the activities of Sir Roger Casement, the Irish agitator, who had been in the United States and paid a visit to Germany, and the claim was made that it was sent at his instigation, as he was a man " easily aggravated ". Nadolny explained that he could no longer remember whether the telegram was formulated in the Political Section, or had been brought in by Casement, but he definitely recalled that the Military Attaché would be advised " that other objects than factories must by no means be attacked and that no act whatever must be done whereby any danger could arise of compromising our representation in the United States or the German-Irish movement." (p. 3.)</p>
<p>256</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>It is contended by Nadolny that the telegram did not " contain an order", and, therefore, he did not communicate with the Mobile General Staff or with the Ministry of War, and the telegram was sent " on my own responsibility ". Nadolny further avers: " From the fact that the telegram did not contain an order, it follows as a matter of course that Mr. von Papen, if he did not agree with it, had the right to disregard it altogether." (Emphasis supplied.) (p. 4.) He repeated a conversation with the Foreign Office where " I had to go very frequently ", to the effect that the Foreign Office told him " that sabotage in the United States must by no means be undertaken". In the light of the subsequent history of sabotage in America while the United States was neutral, the distinction between an " order " for sabotage and " authority " for sabotage would appear to be a form of specious pleading. To substantiate its pleadings, Germany later filed, as German Exhibit CXXIII, an affidavit of Hans Marguerre, a major in the regular army and attached to the " Sektion Politik " of the General Staff, of which Nadolny was the head. In his affidavit, Marguerre related that " Sektion Politik " had sent agents to neutral countries in order to locate establishments producing war material or selling raw material for such production; and to collect in- formation with regard to the production of ammunition, ammunition stores, the shipping of ammunition, and in regard to transports, with the requirement that they should report thereon to undercover addresses or in coded telegrams. The purpose of collecting this information was to enable " Sektion Politik " to collect data as complete as possible about the resources of various neutral countries. He denied that these agents had orders to destroy such establish- ments while the countries were neutral, and then he states (p. 7, Testimony of July 30, 1930): " It is true that as soon as the neutral country entered the war, they [the agents] were im- mediately to start actions against the establishments found by them to be essential for carrying on the war, so that the resources of the now enemy country would be depleted as much as possible. The agents were, therefore, when the neutral country entered the war, to remain in that country and were then to begin actions against ammunition plants and other plants important for carrying on the war. As long as the country was neutral, however, they were only to collect the data * * * and report thereon." (Emphasis supplied.) In denying that their agents had been sent into America to commit sabotage against the American ammunition industry or against American ammunitions, Marguerre said (p. 8) : " It is true, / sent agents to America and provided them with instructions and material to stop American establishments, essential for war, from working, if possible. These instructions, however, were to be followed out only in the event of America entering the war and they were to take effect only from that date on." (Emphasis supplied.) Marguerre related how, in February, 1916, he had a conference in Berlin with Hilken and Herrmann, in which he gave Herrmann similar instructions and furnished him with incendiary devices designed to cause fires and explosions. In justifying this act he said (p. 15): " As I said before, in our organization we took into account all possibilities, also that of America entering the war. On account of the great distance and the supervision of means of transport becoming closer all the time it would have been impossible to send agents and sabotage materials to America after the outbreak of the war. For this reason we had, as I said, to make our preparations in America during neutrality so that in case of America's entering the war we would have agents and material on the other side." (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>257 Marguerre admitted that Hilken was the financial agent of " Sektion Politik " in America for the purpose of furnishing " funds to our agents ". The affidavit clearly discloses that Marguerre, in his conference with Herrmann and Hilken, arranged that Herrmann should draw necessary funds from Hilken, and Hilken was instructed to pay the funds required by Herrmann up to a certain limit without requesting an accounting. Marguerre said he could not confirm Carl Dilger's claim that later he (Dilger) received from Marguerre and Nadolny a trunk with a false bottom containing incendiary devices. He did, however, testify as follows (Testimony of August 1, 1930, p. 2): " Did you send further incendiary pencils to America after Herrmann's departure? " A. I remember that some time after Herrmann's visit we had a trunk made with a double bottom, in order to pack glass tubes therein in a secret partition. I do not know who was entrusted with this trunk." (Emphasis supplied.) He also testified that he could not deny that Carl Dilger was right in claiming that the trunk was delivered to him. The record further shows that devices of this character were also furnished Woehst by Marguerre and brought to this country in the fall of 1916. The record clearly discloses that the incendiary devices which were furnished to Herrmann, to Carl Dilger and to Woehst were used for sabotage in the United States, while the United States was neutral, that these incendiary devices were taken by Herrmann to Mexico for the purpose of setting fire to the Tampico Oil Fields, and that such incendiary devices were also used in the Argentine, which never entered the war. In the light of this record the explanation of Marguerre would seem to pass the bounds of human credulity, and brands his affidavit as false. In Exhibit E, filed with the Answers, Count von Bernstorff, the Ambassador to the United States, denied that he had ever had anything to do, directly or indirectly, with acts of sabotage against munitions plants in the United States or that he had ever lent any support by word or deed or in any other way to such acts. As to the telegram of January 26, 1915, to the Military Attaché, he denied it was submitted to him or that he ever saw it while he was Ambassador. He justified the do-nothing attitude of von Papen, since such action was in accor- dance with the usual procedure between him and von Papen, and he denied that the recall of the Military and Naval Attachés in 1915 had anything to do with sabotage against American property. While Germany denied in its Answers, and specifically through the statement of the Ambassador, Count von Bernstorff, that it was responsible for the activities of Rintelen in this country, the record in this case proves conclusively that Rintelen's activities in this country were connected with inoculating horses and cattle, the destruction of piers and elevators and munitions factories; that he was furnished with incendiary devices by a German chemist, Dr. Scheele, who manufactured bombs and other incendiary material, not only for Rintelen, but for other saboteurs. Hinsch, who was Germany's main lay witness to destroy the authenticity of the Herrmann message, admitted starting his sabotage activities after he met Rintelen in May, 1915, practically two years before America entered the war. In April, 1915, Rintelen met Hilken, the admitted sabotage paymaster in this country; and Rintelen, in his book, The Dark Invader, gives a clear picture of his activities showing that they were not only known to, and approved by, the Military Attaché, but also Count von Bernstorff himself. When Rintelen arrived in this country, two telegrams were sent from the German Government in Berlin to the Embassy in Washington, the first, dated April 4, 1915, reading as follows:</p>
<p>258</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>" Inform RINTELEN who arrives today that (?) RICKET arrived April 21st. Inform him about PAPEN'S proposals." (Ex. 320, rec, p. 818) The second, dated April 5, 1915: " Inform BOY-ED as to PAPEN'S proposals for transmission to RINTELEN." (id. p. 819) Although Count von Bernstorff in his book, My Three Tears, and in his affidavit, disclaims reponsibility for, and knowledge of, the activities of Rintelen, this disclaimer is contradicted, not only by Rintelen himself, but by a telegram dated May 12, 1915, sent by the Ambassador to Berlin, which reads as follows (Ex. 320, Rec. p. 821): " RINTELEN has asked me to give him a letter of introduction to a firm of lawyers who are ready to take legal proceedings against the (?LOCK) Company for supplying munitions, but who are unwilling to proceed with the matter unless RINTELEN is provided with an official introduction. In the circumstances I do not feel justified in compromising the Embassy to any further extent, as any such action on my part might be the last straw which broke the camel's back. I have accor- dingly the honor to request that RINTELEN may be furnished with a letter of introduction by the Ministry of War at the earliest convenience of that Depart- ment." (Emphasis supplied.) A careful analysis of the three telegrams quoted above will show that the Government in Berlin was anxious for Papen's proposals to reach Rintelen immediately upon his arrival in the United States; that the Embassy was apprised by cable of the date of Rintelen's arrival in America; that the Am- bassador did know Rintelen, and that Rintelen knew the Ambassador well enough to request, five weeks after Rintelen's arrival, a letter of introduction to some lawyers who were ready to take proceedings against a company sup- plying munitions, but who were unwilling to proceed unless Rintelen should be provided " with an official introduction ". The Ambassador informs Berlin that he does not feel justified in compromising the Embassy to any further extent, as such action on his part might be the last straw to break the camel's back, but he does have the honor to request his Government to furnish Rintelen with a letter of introduction by the War Department at the earliest convenience of that Department. The fact that the Ambassador did know Rintelen and his mission in America is further proven by the following telegram sent to Berlin on December 10, 1915 (Ex. 320, Rec. p. 824, repetition on p. 825), reading as follows: " Convinced that RINTELEN was principal reason for demanding recall of Attaché. His immediate removal is therefore absolutely necessary. [An imme- diate categorical disavowal absolutely necessary]. Only connection which can possibly be traced with us is the 500,000 dollars received from Naval Attaché and required for the goods exported." (Emphasis supplied.) Rintelen, in his book, The Dark Invader, relates how, a few hours before his departure from Berlin, he provided himself with the necessary " working ca- pital ", which he only succeeded in collecting when the train was getting up steam, and he states that in the short time at his disposal he succeeded in arranging for a cable transfer of half a million dollars as a " starter ". (The Dark Invader, p. 75.) As admitted by Marguerre, Herrmann received from " Sektion Politik " definite instructions in regard to sabotage in Amerika and incendiary devices for that purpose ; and Hilken was furnished with funds upon which Herrmann could draw for sabotage purposes without accounting therefor; and in the early spring of 1916, they went back to America and carried out these instruc-</p>

<p>259 tions while the United States was neutral using for the purpose various sabotage agents, chief among whom was Hinsch. Hinsch admits that, following confe- rences with Rintelen in May, 1915, he had been for a year engaged in sabotage against property in America. The record discloses the fact that Hinsch met Rintelen through Hilken. These agents were engaged in sabotage activities in America against horses and cattle, ships and munitions factories, wharves and warehouses and other forms of property in America. Count von BernstorfF was examined before a subcommittee of the National Constituent Assembly of Germany which was appointed to inquire into the responsibility for the war (Ex. 511, Rec. p. 1802). In the course of this exami- nation Count von Bernstorff, in endeavoring to show why public opinion in the United States veered away from Germany, made the following statement (id. p. 1803): " It was stated by those who were issuing the enemy propaganda, and, I am forced to admit, is looked upon as proven as the result of the investigation by the American Senate, that conspiracies were instigated by Germany in the United States which were in conflict with American laws." He stated that in his opinion there was no conspiracy but: " There were only individual transactions, which, as a matter of fact, were in violation of the laws of the United States but with which we over there, or at least I personally, never had anything to do." Again, referring to Rintelen's activities in the United States (id. p. 1806): " I do not know even today who it was that sent Rintelen to the United States and what his mission was. " It is true that it was alleged in the United States that bombs had been laid on the merchant ships of all nations, and that ammunition factories had been blown up, etc. But I can state here under oath that I do not know whether such cases actually occurred or whether they have been proved." When pressed by the Chairman to say whether the German Government stood behind these acts of sabotage, he answered as follows (id. p. 1807): " Witness Count v. BernstorfF: I should have to have this question very carefully put. Who was the German Government? " The Chairman: Let us say the Foreign Office. " Witness Count v. BernstorfT: Certainly not the Foreign Office. " Delegate Dr. Sinzheimer: Did you know of these agents, particularly Mr. Rintelen, having been provided with money and provided, indeed, with generous amounts of money? " Witness Count v. Bernstorff: With regard to the recall of naval attaché Captain Boy-Ed, I was officially and subsequently informed by the American Government that the reason, which it had hitherto refused to give, why Captain Boy-Ed's recall had been demanded was that proofs had been submitted to the effect that Rintelen had received a half million dollars from him." The insincerity of von Bernstorff, the German Ambassador, is not only shown by his misrepresentation of his relations with Rintelen and of his knowledge of Rintelen's activities, but it is clearly shown by two other telegrams passing between Zimmerman and von Bernstorff, intercepted by British Naval Intel- ligence, the first, ordering the destruction of the Canadian Pacific Railroad, and the second, relating to Canada's demand that the officer guilty thereof should be extradited from the United States.</p>

<p>The authority given by the above telegram was evidently executed by von BernstorfF; for under date of 11th of February, 1915, we find a telegram directly related to the above and reading as follows (Ex. 320, Rec. p. 805) :</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">" MOST SECRET</h3>
<p>" From WASHINGTON To BERLIN No. 251 11th February 1915. (0064) " The carrying out of your telegram No. 386 for Military Attaché, was intrusted to a former officer, who has been arrested after (causing) an explosion on the Canadian Pacific Railway. " Canada demands his extradition. " I request authority to protect him; according to the laws of war, the decision ought presumably to be: Non-extradition, provided that an act of war is proved. " I intend to argue that although the German Government has given no orders, the Government regarded the causing of explosions on an enemy railway as being, since it furthered military interests, an act of war. " (Signed) BERNSTORFF." (Emphasis supplied.) Here is proof positive that von Bernstorff had full knowledge of the organi- zation on neutral American soil of an expedition of sabotage against the Cana- dian Pacific Railroad. In addition, these messages convict von Bernstorff of a willingness to deceive. By the first, he was given instructions to take vigorous measures in order to destroy the Canadian Pacific Railroad in several places. By the second, he expressed his intention to say to the State Department of the United States that " the German Government had given no orders". If, in order to save from extradition the agent employed by him for the destruction, he was willing to inform his own Government of his intention to deceive the State Department, it is not surprising that, in these sabotage cases, he was willing to swear to a falsehood, in order to justify the false pleading filed by his Government. Referring again to the telegram of January 26, 1915, it will be recalled that Germany, in her Answers and by the exhibits filed therewith, claimed that the transmission of this telegram was the act of a mere subordinate, and that it was not authorized by any responsible official or department of the Government of Germany. Upon motion of the American Agent, Germany was called on</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>261 to produce the records relating to this telegram. From these records it appeared that the telegram originated in the Foreign Office, and that the Foreign Office originally drafted the telegram and transmitted the same to Nadolny, of the General Staff, with the request that it be sent to the Military Attaché at Wash- ington. It also appeared that, upon the original, as transmitted by the Foreign Office to Nadolny, as well as upon the original, sent by Nadolny to Stockholm for transmittal to the United States, there were imposed names and initials which proved conclusively that it not only had the approval of the " subordinate ", Nadolny, but that in his capacity as " subordinate ", he was acting for the Foreign Office and that the sending of the telegram was approved by many other responsible German officials. In German Exhibit XXXV filed to substantiate Germany's plea, Nadolny claimed as follows: The cable of January 26, 1915, was the result of the insistence of Sir Roger Casement. Whether the message was formulated in Section III-B or whether the text was brought or sent to him by Casement he could no longer say with certainty, but the text was formulated after his conference with Casement. The telegram contained no order and therefore left the initiative to the Military Attaché. He did not communicate in regard to it with the Mobile General Staff which alone could give orders to the Military Attaché. He did not submit Casement's propositions to the Mobile General Staff and as regards the trans- mission of the telegram, the " Foreign Office acted merely as a technical intermediary " and the " signature of under-secretary Zimmermann could not by any means give to the document the character of a message or instruction by the Foreign Office to Mr. von Papen ". The American Agent asked Germany to produce the document A. S. 56 to which the telegram referred on its face; and finally the Commission requested the production of this instrument. As illustrative of the good faith of Germany in its defense, it is interesting to read the dissent of the German Commissioner from the Order of the Com- mission of May 1, 1929. He said: "The cable of January 26, 1915, was instigated by the Acting General Staff and approved of by the Foreign Office. Both authorities, and thereby Germany, are responsible for the issuance of the message and its consequences. The records referred to by the American Motion cannot add anything to this fact which is established and admitted. They would only be material if it appeared from them that von Papen's sworn statement was untrue. Then the German Government, though knowing from its files that Papen had committed perjury, would have used an illicit defence in presenting Papen's testimony. " This most serious insinuation by the claimants is not supported by the slightest evidence. It means a reflection not only upon Papen but much more upon the attitude of the German Government itself which I am unable to agree to." After A. S. 56 had been produced the defence which Germany had made in her Answer, her arguments and her proof that this message was the unauthor- ized act of a subordinate officer in Section III-B was shown to be false and known to be false. The brief filed by Germany on the 14th day of September, 1929, contains this information about the origin of the telegram (pp. 57, 58) : " It appears from said document that the communication was drafted by one Meyer (then on temporary duty at the Foreign Office and attached to Sir Roger Casement as interpreter), initialed by two members of the Foreign Office (Count Montgelas and Count Wedel), and signed by the Acting Division Chief (signature illegible). * * * * * * * * * 18</p>
<p>262</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>" As it appears now, the message was the result of mutual discussions between Sir Roger Casement, Meyer and Nadolny; it was formulated by Meyer, who had been attached to Casement as interpreter and kind of ' aide de camp ', and it received the sanction of the Foreign Office, not after Nadolny had made his formal request of January 24th, but before. Consequently, Nadolny was mistaken when he stated that ' the Foreign Office acted merely as a technical intermediary ' (Ger. Ex. XXXV, p. 5). As a matter of fact, it took an active part in bringing about the dispatch of the proposition suggested by Sir Roger Casement. " Under the circumstances the German Agent is not in a position to maintain his argument that the message of January 25, 1915, was the blunder of a ' subordinate '. " Apart from that, however, the arguments proffered by him in connection with this subject-matter stand." (Emphasis supplied.) It was subsequently contended as follows: " Since he [von Papen] did not act upon it, the incident is eliminated as a possible factor in the case and it does not matter, therefore, whether the cable originated with members of one or another department of the German Government." (id. p. 59) Thus counsel for Germany were compelled to acknowledge the falsity of the German Answer, and of the exhibits filed therewith, and, in their extremity, they resorted to another equally false statement, namely, that although the authority to commit sabotage was actually given by the Foreign Office and sanctioned by many officials of the German Government, it was not acted upon, and, therefore, was eliminated as a possible factor in the sabotage cases. But the falsity of the German pleading to the effect that sabotage against property in America and against property in other neutral countries was never authorized during the period of neutrality is conclusively shown by two tele- grams that passed between the German Minister of Mexico, von Eckardt, and Marguerre and Nadolny, in charge of " Sektion Politik ", just after America entered the war. Ex. 520, Rec. p. 1847, contains the first telegram, which reads in translation furnished by the German Agent, as follows: " A.S. 1488 pr April 17, 1917, a. m. communie. 4/18 ' Sektion Pol. Gen.

Ann. 21, accompanying Report of German Agent of August 1, 1929.) The above is one of the famous telegrams which were intercepted and decoded by British Naval Intelligence. An examination thereof, in the light of the record in this case, shows that von Eckhardt, the German Minister in Mexico, is forwarding a message from Herrmann, making inquiry as to the whereabouts of Lieutenent Woehst and about $25,000 that he expected would be sent to Hilken, for his (Herrmann's) benefit. The reply to the above telegram is found in U. S. Exhibit 320, Rec. p. 874, and reads as follows:</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">"FROM: S</h3>
<p>B-2 To Mexico</p>
<p>B-2 To Mexico No. 38 13.5.17 "Reply to Tel. No. 17 " Hermann's statements are correct. Nothing is known of Gerds. Wohst has been retired. " The firing of Tampico would be valuable from a military point of view, but the General Staff leaves it to you to decide. " Please do not sanction anything which would endanger our relations with Mexico or if the question arises, give Hermann any open support. * * * * * * *&gt;&gt; (Ex. 320, Rec. p. 874.) A careful analysis of the two telegrams or messages above set out shows clearly that on the 12 th day of April, 1917, six days after America entered the war, Herrmann, promptly after his arrival in Mexico City, called on the German Minister in Mexico, Eckardt, asking for money, and that he also informed the Minister that he had received from the General Staff a year ago a commission, which had been renewed in January by Hilken, to set fire to the Tampico oil fields, and that he now proposes to carry it out, and he wants the Minister to sanction such a plan. The Minister is not certain whether Herrmann and Gerdts, his companion, were German agents and could be trusted, and recites to Marguerre and Nadolny, of the General Staff, that Verdy believed them to be American spies, but he suggests to the General Staff that it might be well for him to deny that he was in touch with Berlin ! The answer sent by the General Staff on the 13th of May is that Herrmann's statements were correct, namely, that Herrmann, ayear before that, had received a commission from the General Staff, which was renewed by Hilken in January, to set fire to the Tampico oil fields; but while the General Staff recognizes that the firing of Tampico would be valuable from a military point of view, the matter is left with German Minister von Eckardt to decide; but the Minister is warned not openly to support Herrmann. These telegrams show beyond the peradventure of a doubt the falsity of Germany's Answer, and this falsity is further shown by the specious explanation given of these telegrams in Vol. II of the " BRIEF ON BEHALF OF GERMANY " ,</p>
<p>264</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>filed November 19, 1928, where these telegrams are discussed in the following language : " In the second case, which occurred in April, 1917, after the United States had entered the war, authorization was given to cripple the source of supply of the Allied Powers for one of the most important war materials (oil) by setting fire to the Tampico oil field in Mexico. At the time the execution of this authorization was under contemplation (April, 1917), the Tampico oil field was controlled by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and other enemy corporations. " In spite of this fact the German Minister to Mexico objected to the plan and, after the German General Staff had left the decision to him, abandoned the scheme because to attack even enemy property in neutral territory was contrary to the German general policy. The matter of the Tampico oil field presents a certain similarity to the greatly-discussed cable of January 26, 1915, in that the former ultimately became the subject of a discretionary permission. In both instances action, if taken, would have been in violation of neutrality. In both instances discretion was granted to the local German authorities and in both instances these local authorities exercised their discretion by refraining from any action and thereby conformed with the general policy which respected the neutrality of the countries involved." (p. 294) It is a fact, as stated in the quotation from the brief above, that the United States did enter the war in April ,1917, that is to say, on the 6th day of April, just six days before von Eckardt's telegram to Marguerre and Nadolny. It is also true that some of the companies operating in the Tampico Oil Field were American oil companies; but it is likewise true that Mexico was at that time and remained, during the war, a neutral country. While the brief tries to justify the authority for sabotage given in the telegram upon the ground that, when the telegram was sent, the United States was at war with Germany, it fails to notice the fact that the authority for sabotage had been given by " Sek- tion Politik " more than a year before the United States entered the war, and that this authority had been renewed in January, 1917, more than two months before the United States entered the war, and the brief completely ignores the fact that the acts of sabotage were to be committed on the soil of neutral Mexico. As stated in the quotation from the brief set out above, there is a certain similarity between the cable of January 26, 1915, and the commission, given by the General Staff to Herrmann the year before the United States entered the war and renewed by Hilken two months before the United States entered the war, to destroy the Tampico oil fields; and there is a great similarity also between the plea in Germany's answer and the argument in Germany's brief. We shall hereafter have occasion to examine with care what the record dis- closes about Gerdts. For our present purpose, it is sufficient to refer to the fact that on August 1, 1917, S. Le Roy Lay ton who had been vice consul to Colombia but had recently been transferred, as American vice consul to Canada, made a report to the Secretary of State on the subject " Plot to blow up the oil wells at Tampico, Mexico, by a German-American ". An examination of this report and of a report of Layton's successor, Claude E. Guyant, American Consul at Barranquilla, Colombia, discloses the fact that Gerdts reported to each of these gentlemen an effort on the part of Herrmann to induce Gerdts to cooperate with him in blowing up the oil fields at Tampico. Herrmann showed Gerdts for the purpose some incendiary tubes which he, in company with Gerdts, had brought from the United States through Havana to Mexico. (Ann. G to Ex. 583, Rec. pp. 2345-2348; Ann. H. to Ex. 583, Rec. pp. 2349- 2354.) This testimony, given only a few months after the United States had entered the war, absolutely corroborates the confessions of Herrmann and Hilken and disproves the false pleading of Germany and the false statements of Marguerre.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>265 With the fraud in the pleadings as a preamble, it now becomes necessary to discuss the further question as to whether there was fraud in the evidence brought before the Commission at The Hague; and whether the conduct of the Counsel for Germany was of such a character as to mislead the Commission and to require the setting aside of the decision at Hamburg. B. Fraud in the Evidence In making an examination of the evidence which was before the Commission at The Hague it is pertinent and proper, so far as the Kingsland disaster is concerned, to begin with Wozniak. (/) Wozniak According to Wozniak's own testimony, the fire started at his bench, and all of the eye witnesses of the fire agree in one statement, namely, that the fire originated at the bench where Wozniak was working. Wozniak, himself, has made many statements with regard to the origin of the fire; but in all of these statements, whatever else may be the variation between them, he has always insisted that when he was cleaning and swabbing out the shell and pulled out the rag which was on the end of a stick, the rag was afire. In other words, Wozniak was the real actor in producing the results that followed, and the main question which was before the Commission at The Hague, so far as the Kingsland disaster was concerned, was whether the fire was caused by the intentional activity of Wozniak. In the opinion at Hamburg the Commission devoted about eight and a half pages to the Kingsland disaster, and, of these, three are devoted almost entirely to Wozniak alone. In another portion of the opinion, the Commission compared Herrmann's story with Wozniak's statements and acts, and this com- parison led it to doubt Herrmann's story and to give credence to Wozniak in the following language (p. 975) : c " The discrepancies and improbabilities of Herrmann's story tend to strengthen our very strong impression from Wozniak's acts and statements at the time of the fire and shortly thereafter and from the circumstances of the fire that Wozniak was not guilty. In the same way our impression of Wozniak, derived from careful study of these acts and statements and circumstances, tends to increase our doubt of Herrmann's sincerity in his latest evidence." (Emphasis supplied.) After making this comparison, the Commission devoted over three pages to the study of Wozniak and his relation to the case, and was inclined to believe that Wozniak, being a crank and smart, but naive, if he had planned to set the fire, would not have started it at his own bench. The Commission examined the letters which were written by Wozniak to the Russian officials before the fire, and came to the conclusion that these letters were not a blind, but such letters as Wozniak, who was at heart a Rus- sian and who intended to go to Russia, would have written, and that he was shocked at the carelessness and the corruption of the inspectors of the plant. The Commission concluded that without relying " at all on his [Wozniak's] honesty of statement he nevertheless seems to us [the Commission] to act and talk like a man who is really innocent in respect to this fire". (Decs, and Ops., p. 978.) a We shall now examine the record with a view to determine whether, if the Commission had had before it the statements made by Wozniak after The Hague, c Mote by the Secretariat this volume, p. 89. d Mote by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 91.</p>
<p>266</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>which directly contradicted, in essential points, his evidence given before that time, and if the Commission had known that the affidavits of Wozniak, filed by Germany, had been filed only after Germany's counsel yielded to blackmail demands and paid Wozniak money for his testimony, it is probable that the Commission would have reached the same conclusion, namely, that Wozniak acted and talked like a man who was really innocent in respect to the fire. It is pertinent, also, to note that, of the oral argument of the German Agent at The Hague, nearly fifty pages of the transcript are taken up with Wozniak, his statements and activities. How Wozniak became a witness for Germany is recited in the affidavit of Dr. Tannenberg, dated 12th day of September, 1929, and filed on that same date (Ger. Ex. LXXXIX (a)). In this affidavit, an explanation is made as to how Wozniak's two affidavits (Ger. Ex. LXXXIX (c) and LXXXIX (d) executed on April 24, 1929) were prepared and executed. In the course of Dr. Tannenberg's affidavit, he recites the employment of Wozniak to assist the German Agent in making an investigation for the purpose of verifying Wozniak's statements (p. 16), and the agreement that Wozniak should be paid $10 a day and expenses, upon the assurance by the German Agent, in answer to Wozniak's inquiry, that such compensation would not affect Wozniak's standing as a witness, because the compensation was not for testifying but for assisting the German Agent in his investigations (p. 17); and the statement is made that he was paid $10 per day for each of 42 days during which he assisted the German Agent in his investigations (see p. 17). Referring to the question of compensation which was paid by Germany to Wozniak, the German Agent, in the oral argument at Washington, November, 1932, stated to the Commission as follows (p. 147) : " Wozniak, during his entire examination in 1929, never asked for money. If I remember correctly, I stated in my affidavit [Sept. 12, 1929] (Exhibit LXXXIX (a) ) that when he was in Washington and I informed him that of course we would have to compensate him for his out-of-pocket expenses and loss of time he stated that that could not be done ; that is, he declined to take even this compensation, to which, as a witness, he was entitled. When our investigation continued, and we, indeed, needed the assistance of Wozniak in order to have him confronted with various witnesses and to verify his story, we paid him his out-of-pocket expenses, and a certain amount for loss of time. As I remember, the investigation required several months, a little more than two months, during which time the witness was at any time at our disposal, no compensation was asked by him, and no compensation was paid to him for his testimony, except his out-of-pocket expenses and his compensation for loss of time, which at that time, as I remember, was $10 a day." (Emphasis supplied.) Wozniak's affidavits of April 24, 1929, were filed on August 20, 1929, and Dr. Tannenberg's explanatory affidavit was filed on September 12, 1929. Dr. Tannenberg, on July 15, 1929, more than a month before Wozniak's affidavits were filed, wrote in his own handwriting a letter to Wozniak in which he inclosed three certificates and in which Dr. Tannenberg explained his delay in forwarding the certificates. The last three paragraphs of this letter read: "Just before my departure Dr. von Lewinski informed me by telephone that you had come to the German Consulate General to see him and that you dis- cussed our matter with him. I hope that Dr. von Lewinski convinced you that our relations are those of friends and gentlemen, that you can have full confidence in himself and myself and that we shall do everything that is possible to protect and assist you. I may assure you again that I am convinced that nobody will bother you,</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>267 since your innocence in the Kingsland matter is completely established. Should somebody from the Company approach you in this matter, I would appreciate it greatly if you would inform me by letter immediately of what was said to you, or, if you prefer to do that, to go to the German Consulate General and discuss the matter there with Dr. von Lewinski. " As regards our last conversation in New York I hope I have convinced you that we have worked and shall work together in full harmony, that I fully under- stand the position taken by you, and that everything will be done by me and Dr. von Lewinski. Mr. Healy's remarks were absolutely his personal ones. I do not share them and disapprove them entirely. He was not authorized to discuss such matters with you. " In order to show you that your confidence in me and Dr. von Lewinski is entirely justified in every respect, I may repeat that Dr. von Lewinski and I are at any time at your disposal. If you want to discuss something with us, just send me or Dr. von Lewinski a note, or ask for Dr. von Lewinski at the German Co- sulate General in New York. I shall always be glad to see you, and so will Dr. von Lewinski. Any question you have in regard to our matter will always be frankly discussed between us. " Let us always remain friends." (Ex. 977, Anns. A-B, Ex. G.) (Emphasis supplied.) Wozniak was paid, in connection with his two affidavits of April 24, 1929, the sum of $450. On July 1, 1930, he was paid $500; and in the latter part of August, just before the departure of the German Agent in September, 1930, for The Hague argument, he was paid $350. After The Hague argument he was paid the following sums: after the return of the German Agent from The Hague —$200; April 16, 1931 —$35; and on April 21, 1931 —$500. In 1930 or 1931, Germany also paid about $1,000.00 in securing his release from a criminal charge. Remembering these payments, it is pertinent to inquire what was meant by the assurances given by the German Agent in his letter of July 15, 1929, when he states as follows: " As regards our last conversation in New York I hope I have convinced you that we have worked and shall work together in full harmony, that I fully under- stand the position taken by you, and that everything will be done by me and Dr. von Lewinski. Mr. Healy's remarks were absolutely his personal ones. I do not share them and disapprove them entirely. He was not authorized to discuss such matters with you." After the decision at Hamburg and after Wozniak found that his source of supply had ceased, he was examined under subpoena before a United States Court under the Act of June 7, 1933 (48 Stat. 117), and testified in August and September, 1933, as follows (Ex. 977, Anns. A-B, p. 42) : " A. In 1929 when I asked Mr. Healy in the Astor Hotel the first time I make affidavit if I going to get extra money for that, he said, ' No, you are going to get just for your time and expenses.' I tell this to Dr. Tannenberg. I was mad about that. He said, ' Mr. Healy has no right to discuss this with you.' " This testimony took place before Dr. Tannenberg's letter of July 15, 1929, was filed in evidence. After that letter was introduced and filed as Exhibit G, he (Wozniak) was then examined as to the contents thereof and testified as follows (Ex. 977, Anns. A-B, p. 122): " Q. Referring to this letter, Dr. Tannenberg says, ' Mr. Healy's remarks were absolutely his personal ones.' What did he refer to? What remarks of Mr. Healy's did he refer to?</p>
<p>A. Something two or three weeks after I started to work with them I asked Mr. Healy what I get for that, my job. He said, ' You are as witness just supposed to get for your time, the time and expenses.' After I told Dr. Tannenberg. He said, ' What for you fool me? ' He say ' That is not true; Mr. Healy got no right to tell you and know nothing about this.' "</p>
<p>268</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>After Dr. Tannenberg's letter to Wozniak of July 15, 1929, the next in sequence was the letter dated September 27, 1929, which was sent by registered mail from Wozniak to Dr. Tannenberg, the body of which reads as follows : (Ex. 977, Anns. A-B, Ex. D, filed September 15, 1933) : " For the last few Months I have not heerd from you and dont know how the matter stands. " On my trip West I stoped in Chicago, and desided to write few words to you. " Will you kindly let me hear from you and tell me when this matter will be finished, and what will I benefit if I help you to save the honor of Germany. " You know what I have done for you in this matter and what I can do as yet??? " Kindly give me your emmidiate answer and tell me what I am realy worth to you in this matter. " Expect to hear from you soon." In spite of the threatening nature of this letter and its ugly tone, Dr. Tannen- berg, on October 3, 1929, wrote Wozniak a friendly letter (id. Ex. E), express- ing his regret at not having had a chance to see Wozniak and to explain his absences from New York, and promising to send Wozniak a complete set of documents, and then the German Agent stated as follows: " You may be sure that in view of the fact that you volunteered your testimony in this matter when nobody could compel you to do so, and that due to your voluntary assistance we succeeded in locating numerous old records concerning you, your future welfare will always be a matter of deep interest to us." To this letter, Wozniak replied, on October 26, 1929, as follows (id., Ex. F.) : " I received your letter. But I am far from being satisfied. Not one word about reward in this matter. When I see this matter in the News, I thought therefore, to offer my services to the Company hunting for its own profit, or to the German Govern- ment is not hunting for money, but fighting for his honor. I have come to this point that it is to Germany I am supposed to offer my services, and I went to the German Consulate under this impression that the German Government is going to be interested in, prize my services and my condition, and do his best for me without asking for it. But it looks to me as if I am forgotten already. Every one who knows something about this matter laughs at me now. They tell me I offered my services to the German Government for nothing. I was working so hard with my nerves that I became sick again. Before this investigation I weighed 150 pounds, now I weigh only 140, and all my friends dislike me under the circumstances. " When I came to Chicago, before I realized in what kind of position and condition I am, this story was in Chicago newspaper, and now I can get no good job nor reference from anyone. I know one lawyer said to my friend (I met him in Chicago and he knew me from Scranton, Pa.) ' This man is not supposed to play open, it is a big and serious case.' They arrested him, put him in jail, depor- ted, or bump him off, out of the way. " Now you can understand the condition and position I am in.

<p>269 " I wish to win this case as soon as possible, and be satisfied and don't forget about me." (Emphasis supplied.) The underscored [emphasized] portions of this letter can be interpreted in no other light than that of a threat of blackmail. In the oral argument at Washington, in 1932, the German Agent stated that after Wozniak's evidence was submitted, Wozniak left New York and went west and that they did not know where he was, and it was not possible to get into communication with him, but that Wozniak had come back again in 1930 and had been cross-examined by the American Agent. The letters which have been quoted above show conclusively that the German Agent did know where Wozniak was and that he was able to, and in fact did, communicate with him. In a letter dated February 10, 1932, written to the American Agent, which the German Agent read into the record in the course of his argument (Oral Argument 1932, p. 128), he used the following language: "When I returned to this country at the end of March, 1931, I had several conversations with Wozniak. In these conversations he indicated very strongly that he expected payment of a large sum of money by us. I advised Wozniak that no such payment could be made. Wozniak repeated his request at every conversation I had with him and, finally, advised me that if his request was not complied with, he would accept an offer which had been made to him and which would cause me great regret. I, thereupon, broke off my relations with Wozniak and have not seen him since." (Emphasis supplied.) In view of this statement, it is remarkable that the German Agent should have, on April 25, 1931, written Wozniak a letter, which reads as follows (Ex. 977, Anns. A-B, Ex. H) : " I received yesterday your registered letter. As I told you last week, I shall go to New York as soon as I have finished the brief which the Commission re- quested to be filed. This brief has to be filed by Monday next week, that is the 27th of April, so that it is impossible for me to be in New York on Monday morning, since I have to work here until Monday night. I shall go to New York, as originally planned, on Tuesday morning, that is the 28th, and will be at the German Con- sultate General around 2 o'clock in the afternoon. From that time on I will be at any time at your disposal. I hope I can stay there until Wednesday or Thursday. I have to be back in Washington soon because I have to prepare a further brief in the same matter during the first part of May. " Your information that the case will be decided on or before May 1st is erro- neous. As I said before the Agents still have to prepare further briefs during the first part of May and nobody can say at the present when the Commission will render its decision in this matter, particularly in view of the fact that the German Commissioner is at present in Germany. The Commission merely fixed May 1st as the time limit within which the American Agent should file the further evidence which he announced he would file in support of his petition for the reopening of the tase. " I hope that I can see you on Tuesday. We can then discuss everything and decide how to proceed." This letter was written immediately after Wozniak had cashed the German Agent's order on the Consulate for $500. The registered letter written by Wozniak and referred to in the above letter has never been introduced in evidence. As we know, Wozniak's demands did not begin in March, 1931, but had begun at least eighteen months earlier, to-wit, before July 15, 1929, and had been the subject of correspondence and conversations between the German Agent and Wozniak. The tone of the German Agent's reply to Wozniak's registered letter would seem to indicate that</p>
<p>270</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>Wozniak was anticipating the early decision of the case, and accordingly was again demanding a " show-down " as to his reward, for the German Agent is careful to correct Wozniak as to his information that the case would be decided by May 1st, and closes with this statement: " I hope that I can see you on Tuesday. We can then discuss everything and decide how to proceed.'1 (Emphasis supplied.) Evidently the demands in Wozniak's registered letter were of the same character as in his letters written in the summer and fall of 1929. It will be recalled that Wozniak made a trip to Washington on April 16th, 1931, and disclosed to Tannenberg the fact that he had received an offer in regard to the sale of his story to a magazine. In regard to this offer, Wozniak testified as follows (Ex. 977, Anns. A-B, p. 128) : " I told him about this offer in Washington April 16th [1931]. " Q.. That was on April 16th? A. Yes. " Q_. That you told him you had an offer from somebody else? A. Yes, and he told me, ' Don't do that,' and tell me wait; and between April 16th and April 30th I received from him 55500 to make me happy. " Q.. Between April 16th and April 30th you received $500 from Mr. Carl Loerky at the Consul General's office? A. Yes. " Q,. And that S500 was paid to you so that you would not accept the other offer that had been made to you by Mr. Bishop? A. That was paid to me to believe them, they good to me. " Q_. That was paid to you for what? A. To believe in them, they good to me. " Q_. In order to make you believe that they were good to you and would keep their promises; is that what you mean? A. Yes." And, again, on p. 120, he was asked: " Did Dr. Tannenberg advise you what you should do about the offer? A. He said, ' Forget it.' " Q_. He said ' forget it '? A. Yes, ' Don't do that.' " At the conference between Wozniak and Tannenberg in Washington on April 16th, he got an order for $500 which was paid him in cash at the German Consulate's office in New York; and subsequent to the receipt of this money, the German Agent wrote the letter of April 25th, 1931, in which, as we have seen above, he expresses the hope that he would see Wozniak in New York on Tuesday and that " We can then discuss everything and decide how to proceed". In his 1932 argument in Washington, the German Agent stated that up to the beginning of 1931 he had not been in contact with Wozniak after the summer of 1930; that in the beginning of 1931 Wozniak was arrested on a flimsy charge; that they assisted in getting him out on bail, but by that time the witness had lost every bit of his courage. He had been shadowed by detectives. He had been arrested and placed in an awful situation; his rooms had been searched, and then the German Agent said : " He began, as I said in my letter to the American Agent, then to make demands. * * * Of course, we could not compensate the witness even for those troubles * * * ; but finally he made a demand for money, which I of course had to decline, and he disappeared, and, as I said before, I have never seen him again." (pp. 147, 148.) (Emphasis supplied.) A careful study of the above and of the letters passing between Dr. Tannen- berg and Wozniak up to and including April 25, 1931, discloses that, whatever demands had been made, either early in 1931 or in the registered letter from Wozniak, received by Dr. Tannenberg on April 24th, but never produced in the record, these demands could not have differed in character from the demands that began in July, 1929.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>271 A perusal of the letter written by Wozniak to Dr. Tannenberg on August 13, 1931, and Dr. Tannenberg's reply of August 19, 1931, fails to disclose that, even as late as August 19, 1931, Dr. Tannenberg had renounced Wozniak or broken off his relations with him (See Ex, 977, Anns. A-B, Exs. I &amp; 1-1)- On the question of the amount of his compensation, Wozniak testified as follows (Ex. 977, Anns. A-B, p. 35) : " Q. How much has the German Government paid you in all for your services in connection with this case? A. Altogether I got two thousand and twenty dollars. " Q. Two thousand and how much? A. Two thousand and twenty dollars. " Q_. Did they ever promise you any more than that? A. They promised me — they promised me a whole lot, but after they say they don't care, ' We got you where we want you, and what you going to do? You open your mouth and you are going to be arrested.' And Mr. Healy promised me Atlanta and deportation. " Q_. Healy told you they would sent you to Atlanta? A. Yes. " Q. Which you understood to be a Federal prison? A. Yes. " Q. And that after you served your term they would have you deported? A. Yes. " Q. Did you ever make any demands on Germany for more money than they paid you, the two thousand dollars? A. He promised me. I tell him I want him to give me in writing. " Q. You wanted him to give you in writing what they were going to pay you? A. Yes, I said I did not believe in promises. " Q,. That you did not believe in promises? A. Yes, because they fool me. They said German Government never going to give me agreement, because Dr. Von Lewinski promised me, he said, ' When I go to Hague and I come back we going to make some kind of agreement.' " Q. That when he came back he would make some kind of agreement? A. Then he pay me S200, when he come back. He went to Germany and don't say a word about agreement. After Dr. Tannenberg, I told him, ' You promise me this agreement; I want this agreement.' He said, ' German Government never going to give you no agreement.' He said, when he wins his case, ' Maybe I help you something, to open some kind of speakeasy.' " Q.. Was that Dr. Tannenberg or Mr. Healy? A. Dr. Tannenberg. He told me he going to help me to open a store, something to give me a start, like speakeasy. " Q.- When was it Mr. Healy told you that he would make an agreement with you after he came back from The Hague? When was that? A. Dr. Von Lewinski, when he go to Hague, he told me in Washington that time." In the light of this record, a careful study of the letters passing between the German Agent and Wozniak beginning July 15, 1929, and closing with Woz- niak's letter of October 26, 1929, establishes the following propositions: First, before the letter of July 15, 1929, was written, Wozniak's compensation had been the subject of a conversation between Wozniak on the one side and Dr. von Lewinski on the other, and Dr. von Lewinski had tried to convince Wozniak that their relations were those of " friends and gentlemen ". After the conversation with Dr. von Lewinski, Wozniak had another conversation with Dr. Tannenberg, and Dr. Tannenberg again assured Wozniak that " we have worked and shall work together in full harmony "; and he further assured Wozniak that Healy's statement, to the effect that Wozniak would only receive his witness' fees, were Healy's personal remarks and that he, Dr. Tannenberg, did not share them; Second, Wozniak in an ugly mood on September 27, 1929, wrote a hold-up letter, asking when the matter would be finished, what benefit he would get out of saving the honor of Germany and demanding to know immediately " what am I really worth to you in this matter ";</p>
<p>272</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>Third, in spite of this hold-up letter Dr. Tannenberg replied in a very con- ciliatory letter, assuring Wozniak that on account of his voluntary assistance " your future welfare will always be a matter of deep interest to us " ; Fourth, upon the receipt of the letter of October 3rd, 1929, Wozniak wrote to Dr. Tannenberg his blackmail letter of October 26, 1929, which must be interpreted as containing a threat. In spite of the passage of these letters between the two, from which Wozniak's true character is shown in every page, the German Agent continued to secure and file in behalf of Germany affidavits made by Wozniak. The first two affidavits of Wozniak, filed on behalf of Germany, were filed after Tannenberg's letter of July 15, 1929. After these letters had passed, Wozniak was finally located by the American Agent at Tupper Lake in com- pany with Counsel for Germany; and he was finally produced by the German Agent for examination at Washington on July 22, 23, 1930, and at New York on July 28-30, 1930. (Ger. Ex. CXXII, consisting of 368 pages). After the series of letters set out above were completed, and after Wozniak's examination by the two Agents, the German Agent, on August 26, 1930, filed German Exhibit CXXXI, which consists of an affidavit with annexes from A to W, the whole comprising 133 pages. If, as Dr. Tannenberg contended in the Washington argument, in 1932, Wozniak's degradation followed the refusal of the German Agent to continue him on the payroll, why did the German Agent bring him to Washington on April 16, 1931, give him $35 for the round trip expenses and give him an order on the German Consul for $500 which was paid on April 21, 1931? If there was any decline in Wozniak's character which made him unfit as a witness, that decline began before Dr. Tannenberg's letter of July 15, 1929, and it continued on a fast-sliding scale following the subsequent payments to Wozniak, all of which were known to the German Agent and not only concealed from the Commission but were the subject of misrepresentation at the 1932 Washington argument. This conduct of the German Agent, relating to the suppression of the letters and of the payments to Wozniak and the misrepre- sentation of his relations to Wozniak, is aggravated by the innuendoes in the German Agent's argument at Washington by which he endeavored to turn Wozniak's threat to sell his information to a magazine into a representation that he was being bribed by the claimants. As an index of Wozniak's character as a witness, it is necessary and proper to examine a letter written in July, 1932, by Wozniak to Franz von Papen, Chancellor of Germany, at Berlin (Ex. C) with Ex. 977, Anns. A-B), which was returned in the same envelope. In that letter Wozniak makes the claim that the company could not win the case without his help. He knows how important and valuable it was for Germany to win the case and " because Company not ask for my # secrets #, ignored, I decided to offer my help to the German Government, whit belive and hope in good reward. I give up my partnership with American Foreign Claims Bureau and start work for Ger- many." Then the letter goes on to state: " At that time Dr. Tannenberg promise-good percentage, big money, good position and etc. Dr. K. von Lewinski, also promise reward, split money and to make some a agnment with me, but went to the Germany, with out nothing, Mr. T. Healy a Lawyer to thr German Government, also told me a fairy story about reward from Germany and asked if, I give him 10%, from this amount, which a get from Germany, and etc."</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>273 Later he says : " And what sort of rewards I received or was promised from German Govern- ment, for helping to klear the Honor of Germany, and won 22.000.000.? " NOTHING ! And beside, was warned-not to tell true and change story, * * * " And later he says : " When I see Dr. Tannenberg last time, on March 30-1931 he talk to me in different manner, in high tone, not a like in 1929. He told me $ witnes not entitled to no rewards, it is againste rule and honor, witnes should be paid-only-for his expenses and lose of time. But if Germany again won this case, maybe I could help you with something #•." This letter not only illustrates Wozniak's character as a witness, but also illustrates the fact that a bought witness does not want to stay bought and that his hungry craw must be filled in order to " keep him in line ". Wozniak's Letters and Postcard to the Russians The Kingsland disaster started on the afternoon of January 11, 1917. Woz- niak, in the early summer of 1916, had secured employment at the Kingsland plant through the production of an identification from the Russian Vice Consul Florinsky. Under date of December 15, 1916, he addressed a letter from Kingsland to the Russian Supply Committee, complaining that " only here something is wrong ", apprising him of his determination to write, but he did not know the address of the Russian Military Committee. This letter was forwarded to Major General Khrabroff, Chairman of the Artillery Commission, by Baron Korff, Secretary of the Russian Technical Bureau, with request that the per- sonnel of the inspection be urgently increased at the plant and that a night watch be instituted (Ex. 725, Ann. 4, pp. 4554-4556). Under date of December 26, 1916, Wozniak addressed another letter in the same tone, saying that something is wrong in the Kingsland factory — " It smacks of the Miafsoyedov spirit " — and also saying that he knows that his letter will bring no c esired benefit; that he is writing this letter in order to avoid the reproach of someone vl o might say "You knew, why did you not report to those in charge." (Ex. 725, Ann. 5, Rec. p. 4556.) When he was en fs-examined by the American Agent on the above letters, he was asked whether in 1929 he told Dr. Tannenberg about having written letters to the Russian Supply Committee. His answer was no and his reason was " I thought this letter was destroyed — nobody know I wrote this letter." (Ger. Ex. CXXII, Wash. Tr. p. 56) * And again he said (id. p. 57) : " If I know this letter still exist, I tell him; but I think this letter was not still in existence. I not want to make fool for myself." After he had been shown the letters and he corrected the translation of the second, he admitted again that he did not tell Dr. Tannenberg about these two letters, " because I thought those letters was thrown in the basket", (id. p. 180.) General Khrabroff in Exhibit 698 (Rec. pp. 4425, 4427), after testifying with reference to the receipt of the two letters, testified that on the day before 1 An original executed copy of this examination has never been filed with the Commission. See Motion of German Agent filed August 13, 1930, submitting copy of Ex. CXXII.</p>

<p>the fire, that is on January 10, 1917, he received a further communication from Theodore Wozniak in the form of a post card which was delivered to General Kasloff and was sent, according to his recollection, to Russia with General Kasloff's reports. An English translation of the post card reads about as follows : " Things are getting worse and worse with us. There will be a catastrophe." (id. p. 4428.) After the fire, Wozniak visited General Khrabroff at the Flat Iron Building in New York City and admitted that he had written the second letter referred to above and the post card, and his explanation of the circumstances was not satisfactory and led Generals Khrabroff and Kasloff to believe that Wozniak had caused the fire. In German Exhibit CXXII, Wash. Tr. p. 185, Wozniak denied sending a postal card to General Khrabroff, and in German Exhibit CXXXI, Annex E? he repeated his denial as follows: " I never wrote a postcard to General Khrabroff or anyone else concerning con- ditions at Kingsland. He must suffer from hallucinations as a result of the dirty work at Kingsland." When he was examined under subpoena in 1933 (Ex. 977, Anns. A-B), he testified that a few days before the fire he sent two letters but got no answer, then " I sent post cards." The " s " seems to be a typographical error because of the next question which was asked him by the American Agent as follows : " Before you sent that post card or these letters had you heard these German spies talking about blowing up the factory? A. I hear before." (id. p. 28) (Emphasis supplied.) He also testified to meetings with German agents both before and after the fire, and to having received from such agents small sums of money from time to time (id. pp. 20-24, 145-148, 170-171). In his examination before the Department of Justice (Ex. 998, Ann. J (a), p. 8) he testified in regard to meeting with some German agents and discussing the question of the best method of causing a fire. One recommended an incendiary pencil. Hinsch advised nitrate, and someone else recommended phosphorus, and this was adopted. He then described how to operate a rag dipped in phosphorus in order to cause a fire, and was positive that the rags which were used at Kingsland were " prepared at Nick's house in Rutherford". Then he testified as follows : " When they started to talk seriously how to set a fire, I remembered my pro- mise to the Russians (only to get information what the Germans were doing) and because of my personal feelings and that I was scared to be suspected, I was against them, and did not want to lose the day from work, I did not go to the Russian Consulate in New York. (I missed only one day when I signed a petition to become a Russian citizen, and when I sent money to Russia). Instead I wrote a letter to my friend at the Russian Consulate, but there was no reply. Later I found out he was sick, and someone else read his letters. Then I wrote to the Russian Embassy at Washington. The letter was sent with an ordinary stamp and my return address, but again no reply. After two weeks I mailed another letter, registered, to the Russian Embassy at Washington in which I stated that at the Kingsland factory it smelled of the spirit of Myassoyedoff, but again no reply. Then I sent a last warning on a postal card. Two days later the fire (at the Kingsland plant) broke out. While I was preparing my statement for Germany (August, 1930) I do not remember whether I stated anything about the postal card or not. But Mr. Healy said, ' Scratch out this part, it looks bad before the Commission. You must remember everything.' Lately I have found out that those letters were sent by the Russian ambassador, B. Bakhmstieff, to the Russian Supply Committee,</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>275 which was in charge of General Charabroff and his aid, B. Brosol, but they failed to investigate and / charge those two men responsible for a fire in Kingsland factory. • * * " (id. p. 9) (Emphasis supplied.) Before the argument at The Hague, Wozniak had twice denied sending a postal card. In the above quoted testimony, he now admits that he " sent a last warning on a postal card ", and " Two day later the fire (at the Kingsland plant) broke out ", and he claims that this statement was given to Mr. Healy who advised him to scratch out the part about the postal card. His reason for sending the letters was " / was scared to be suspected ". In Exhibit 977, Annex B-B, being the examination in 1937 by the Immi- gration and Naturalization Service, Wozniak, in answering a question that had no relevance whatever to the answer given said (Exam, of April 26, 1937, pp. 8,9): " I sent one letter to the Russian Consulate in New York, but I didn't get an answer. * * * then I sent a post card, but no answer, and at that time the factory was destroyed; when I sent a registered letter to Washington they should send somebody to investigate what I know — if somebody come to me, they catch everything, but they ignored.it. " Q. Did these men talk to you about the explosion that was to take place? A. Yes, many times about the explosion — they make experiments." In the testimony given after the decision at Hamburg, Wozniak not only contradicted his previous statement with reference to the post card, but also showed conclusively that he was in touch with a gang of spies who were ope- rating within and without the plant. He became thoroughly conscious of the fact that an effort was going to be made to burn up the plant; and, so far from being patriotic in making his reports to the Russians in regard to the conditions in the plant, he " was scared to be suspected " and, therefore, he wrote the letters. Certainly if he had no intention to become involved in the plot to blow up Kingsland, it was not necessary for him, nearly one month before the fire, to be " scared that he was going to be suspected " when the fire did take place. His careful description of the meeting of the plotters, their dis- cussion of the best method to start the fire, his references to the chief spy, and his early denial of the post card which was sent two days before the explosion warning that " there will be a catastrophe ", not only convict him of falsehood in his early testimony but bring the fire close to his doorstep. In his argument at The Hague, the German Agent laid great stress upon Wozniak's testimony (Oral Arguments, 1930, pp. 349 et seq.). He related how Wozniak presented himself to the German Consulate, and the long time it took to check Wozniak's story; and said that the story was not produced before the Commission until they were sure he was corroborated and had told the truth, and all facts had been investigated and found true. He further said : " There was no postal card written by Wozniak to the Russian Embassy at all." (id. p. 363.) He denied that the letters sent to the Russians were a blind, and he argued that Wozniak gave the impression of a patriot and an honest man fulfilling his duty to his country (id. p. 365). The conclusion set forth by the German Agent is as follows: " The Russian material has shown to the Commission, among other things, that Wozniak's actions at the time of the fire, and subsequently, were those of an innocent man." (id. p. 373.) 1 1 This estimate of Wozniak was repeated by the German Agent as late as the Oral Argument at Washington in 1932 (p. 143).</p>
<p>276</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>The Commission, in its decision, agreed with the contentions of the German Agent, and concluded that the letters to the Russian Embassy were not a blind, but exactly such letters as Wozniak would compose; and the Commission seemed to ascribe to him a form of patriotism, for it indicated that he really was at heart a Russian and intended to go to Russia, and was shocked by the carelessness and corruption at the Kingsland plant, and the Commission con- cluded " that he acted and talked like a man who was really innocent in respect to the fire." An honest workman, with nothing to conceal, learning of a conspiracy to destroy the plant and to imperil hundreds of lives, would not have resorted to " a letter to the Russians" but would have gone to some responsible superior in the plant or to the police; and Wozniak's failure to bring to the proper local authorities the information and fears disclosed in his letters and postal card to the Russian Embassy at Washington, coupled with his conduct at and since the fire, convict him of complicity in the design and result. Wozniak's Contradictory Statements In German Exhibit LXXXIX (d), Wozniak, speaking of the Kingsland fire, said: " I did not start the fire purposely. It is not true that I wanted to set fire at the Kingsland factory and that I did so. I never had such an idea and nobody told me to do such a thing." (id. p. 5) He also denied knowing any German spies and denied knowing Fred Herr- mann or Fred March (id. p. 6). In the examination of Wozniak before the two Agents in July, 1930, he made the same denials and denied that he was ever connected with any German agent (Ger. Ex. CXXII, Wash. Trans, p. 14). He also denied that anybody ever gave him any incendiary pencils (id. New York Trans, pp. 38-40; 44-46). He denied that he knew Hinsch (id. New York Trans, p. 128). When con- fronted with Herrmann, he denied knowing him (id. p. 138). In his testimony given after the Hamburg decision, Wozniak reversed himself on all of the foregoing points. In his examination under subpoena, he admitted that there were German spies inside the Kingsland plant, and said: " I heard them. I meet them." (Ex. 977, Ann. A-B, p. 21.) He said their headquarters were in Rutherford, they were well organized and he met in Rutherford the head spy named Mike, and his wife. This head spy was employed in the plant working at the next table to him; he met him a few times in December, 1916, or January, 1917 (id. pp. 20-23). He also admitted getting some money from these spies in Hoboken and Rutherford (id. pp. 170, 171). In his examination before the Department of Justice (Ex. 998, J (a) ) Wozniak admits knowing " Nick, Hinsch and the boy ", and discussing a plan how to set a fire (See supra, p. 50). In his examination before the Immigration and Naturalization authorities, Wozniak swore that he met Herrmann while working at Kingsland and knew him a month before the explosion (Ex. 977, Ann. B-B, Exam. April 26, 1937, p. 6). It will be recalled that in all of his affidavits filed before Hamburg, Wozniak always denied any responsibility for the fire and any knowledge that it had been other than an accident. After Hamburg, in Exhibit 977, Annexes A-B, he was asked to describe the plans that he had heard German agents making</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>277 for blowing up or setting fire to the Kingsland factory and the following colloquy ensued (p. 145): " Q.- What plan did you ever hear them discuss? A. I heard about this pencil and about the rag with phosphorus. " Q_. You heard the two plans, one to use the pencil? A. Yes. " Q_. And the other to use a rag saturated in phosphorus? A. Yes, one plan was used — I forget just now. " Q_. Would a rag saturated in phosphorus create a flame inside of a shell? A. I think it was, because I was not there when this job was done, where they got the rag I do not see, but I hear it. " Q. But you know, do you, that someone set fire to the Kingsland plant? A. Yes. " Q,. You know that, don't you? A. Yes. " Q,. Do you know who it was set fire to the Kingsland plant? A. That is supposed to be I did. " Q. Yes, but do you know who it was? Was it you? — A. I used this rag, but at that day this man, not himself but tell another man — another man give big bunch of rags to me. He said, ' Here is some more clean rags.' " Q. A man brought you a bunch of rags? A. Yes. " Q_. You did not select the rags yourself? A. No, that was his job. It would take some time to take clean rags from me, too. " Q. You mean it would take some time for you to leave your bench and go and get the clean rags? A. Yes." It will be noted that when he was asked the question: " Do you know who it was set fire to the Kingsland plant? " — his answer was — " That is supposed to be I did" (id. p. 146). In Wozniak's examination of May 13, 1931, at the Roosevelt Hotel (Ex. 977, Ann. C), we find the following (p. 6) ; " Q. But supposing Commissioner Anderson asked you, would you tell him that you did set the fire on behalf of Germany? " A. I would tell him. " Q.. You admit it? A. Yes, I admit it. That was set so easily. " Q. No witnesses? A. No witnesses. I was scared. " Q.. You were scared? A. I was scared for myself. I had no agents helping me at that time; just a bunch of rags. " Q.. What? A. A bunch of rags." While this testimony is vague, it is in great contrast to his testimony before The Hague where he always denied that he knew anything about anybody being responsible for the destruction at Kingsland and contended that it was an accident, although the fire started at his bench. Wozniak's Conduct Immediately Preceding, During, and After the Fire Exhibit 348, Rec. p. 1307, is the affidavit of Maurice Chester Musson, verified and filed March 12, 1927. Musson stated that he had been employed in the Kingsland Plant in the early summer of 1916 and remained there until the fire on January 11, 1917, as foreman of a gang of men whose duties were to remove from the spaces between the tables racks filled with cleaned shells and replace them with empty racks; that the men at the tables were supplied with pans of alcohol and rags used in polishing the shells, and that there were pails of waste alcohol under the tables ; that the fire originated at the table of " Fiodor Woznayk ", whose photograph he recognized. He then testified as follows (Rec. p. 1308): " 6. I noticed that this man Woznayk had quite a large collection of rags and that the blaze started in these rags. I also noticed that he had spilled his pan of 19</p>
<p>278</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>alcohol all over the table just preceding that time. The fire immediately spread very rapidly in the alcohol saturated table. I also noticed that someone threw a pail of liquid on the rags or the table almost immediately in the confusion. I am not able to state whether this was water or one of the pails of refuse alcohol under the tables. My recollection however, is that there were no pails of water in the building, the fire buckets being filled with sand. Whatever the liquid was it caused the fire to spread very rapidly and the flames dropped down on the floor and in a few moments the entire place was in a blaze. " 7. It was my firm conviction from what I saw and I so stated at the time, that the place was set on fire purposely, and that has always been and is my firm belief." In his contemporaneous statement on January 17, 1917 (Ex. 611, p. 2683), Musson testified that as soon as he saw the small blaze it jumped into a large blaze and " Some of the other fellows threw rags on the flame." He also said: " Between you and I, think it was set on fire." In Wozniak's statement, dated January 15, 1917, Exhibit 2 to Exhibit 726, Rec. pp. 4680, 4681, after describing how he dipped his brush in the solution contained in a small pan sunk in the table and with it cleaned out the inside of the revolving shell, he then said : " I then swabbed out the inside of the shell with some cleaning rags which were not very clean. I next placed a clean swab of cloth inside of the revolving shell. I noticed it was quite stiff and upon placing this cleaning swab in the shell, a flame burst from the interior of the shell which ignited the fumes, from the pan immediately in front of it. I tried to put the flame out by throwing a cloth over it, but it spread so rapidly I could do nothing and in a moment the flames shot up along the electric light cord above the table to the ceiling and the interior of the ceiling blazed up. At the same time the flames spread along the table to the next pan and continued to run southerly along the table. There was a receptacle standing on the floor beneath the pan set in the table which had a small quantity of the cleaning solution in it, which had dripped through. This likewise took fire." This statement, when read in connection with the statements of other eye- witnesses, particularly the references to the use of rags, is, to say the least, suspicious of an intentional effort on the part of Wozniak not only to start a fire but also to spread it when once started. Thomas Steele, on January 12, 1917, testified (Ex. 611, pp. 2679, 2680), that he saw fire burning in the pan of the Austrian and when the Austrian was leaving, he saw a fire in his pan, and then the fire appeared in the next pan nearest to the Italian; that he took down a bucket of water and put out the fire in the Italian's pan and some workman took a piece of board from the bench and struck the Austrian's burning pan and the liquid poured out and ran along the bench, burning and setting fire along the whole bench. In a statement by LaScola dated January 11, 1917, describing the fire (Ger. Ex. CXIX), he said: " A Russian was cleaning a shell with a brush a spark from the shell fell on the Table where there was gas and oil, which caused a flame. The Russian tried to put the fire out with a rag which caused the rag to burn." In his statement dated January 13, 1917 (Ex. 886, Ann. B-6), LaScola said: " As soon as the fire started on the table the man at the machine tried to smother the fire with rags, and that set the rags afire and he dropped them and ran for a pail of water, * * * ."</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>279 In his statement of January 16, 1917 (Ex. 898, Ann. C), LaScola said: " While I was watching this man [at whose table the fire started] cleaning the shell I saw a small spark come from the shell and almost instantly I saw fire start on the table. I saw the blaze on the table and it was about three feet square. I saw one man run for water and heard men calling for water. I did not wait to see anything more * * *. I saw the spark fly from the shell and almost instantly I saw the fire on the table. * * * I am positive the fire started inside of building # 30 as I saw the spark fly from the shell and saw the fire on the table and at this time I was only ten feet away from where the fire started." In his affidavit of August 2, 1930 (Ger. Ex. CXV, p. 7), L'aScola said: " some of the men took rags and tried to smother the fire and the rags were soaked with benzine." He also said, p. 10, that the man at whose machine the fire started " took rags right from the table and tried to smother the fire with them." And, again: " When they started to beat them with rags they got larger." In his affidavit of April 26, 1933, LaScola (Ex. 980, Ann. E), describing the fire said : " At the time of the fire I was about ten feet away and out of the corner of my eye I saw a small flame and saw the man with a rag saturated in benzine try to put out fire with it but instead caused the flame to spread and increase, and another man threw a pail of water on the flames spreading them more and then everybody ran." In the statement of Anthony Adamo, dated January 17, 1917 (Ex. 886, Ann. B-l), he said: " The first I saw of the fire was burning rags on the floor, and the man at the machine # 1 , a Russian, trying to stamp them out with his feet." Here is evidence that the burning rags were put on the floor by Wozniak. In the statement of John Sulemnob (Ex. 886, Ann. B-l 4), he said: " It commenced in a rag and the man who was working at the machine, the first one, took the rag, threw it on the floor and stamped on it: tiying to put the fire oui. Before doing that he tried to put the blaze out with his hands on the table. I do not know whether this rag had been inside the shell or not." If Wozniak intended to set fire to the gasoline in the pan under the table, it was easy enough to give an impression that he was trying to stamp on the burning rag. In the contemporaneous, undated, statement of Rudolph Alexander Walker (Ex. 886, Ann. B-16) he said: " I noticed a flame coming from the pan sunk in the table at the first machine. * * * As soon as the first pan blazed up the flame spread down along the table." George Robbins, in his statement of January 13, 1917 (Ger. Ex. CXIX), said: " I noticed he stalled the shell and the brush was afire when he pulled it out. He tried to extinguish the fire with rags." In his affidavit of August 6, 1930, but only filed on September 14, 1937 (Ger. Ann. 128), Victor Frangipane, in describing the fire, said that it was due to a sparking motor on which there was a rag saturated with alcohol or benzine, which caught fire from the sparks.</p>
<p>280</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>In his affidavit of the 22nd day of January, 1917 (Ex. 898, Ann. B), Victor Frangipane had testified exactly the contrary, namely, that he did not see any spark or other means of communicating the fire to the place where he first saw it, but that the fire appeared to be coming from the gasoline pan on the top of the table. In his affidavit of the 26th day of April, 1933 (Ex. 980, Ann. F), Frangipane again denied that he saw any sparks coming from the machines or motor; but in his affidavit of the 6th day of August, 1930, and also of the 26th day of April, 1933, he referred to the fact that Wozniak threw some gasoline-soaked rags on the fire. In Exhibit 980, Ann. F, he said: " I noticed a flame at Wozniak's bench. I saw Wozniak throw some gasoline soaked rags onto the flame and then he ran away." And in German Annex 128, he said: " As this rag was blazing the man, whose name I cannot remember, who was working on # 1 machine, ran and grabbed the blazing rag and stamped on it. He could not put out the flame and picked up this blazing rag and ran around his work bench with it. On this bench there was a pan with alcohol or benzine in it, and while this man was running around the work table with this blazing rag in his hand this pan caught fire and began to blaze." When the above evidence is considered in connection with Wozniak's confession that he was in touch with German saboteurs, that they planned to start a fire with phosphorus, and that he was furnished rags soaked with phos- phorus, the inference seems to be clear that, in spreading the gasoline over his table and in using rags soaked with an inflammable liquid (whether gasoline, benzine or phosphorus), ostensibly for the purpose of putting the fire out, Wozniak was intentionally spreading the fire and that he purposely used the burning rags to set fire to the gasoline pan which was on his table, as well as to the pan which was under the table. Wozniak's Character as a Witness The Commission at Hamburg, while stating that its impression of Wozniak's innocence was not due to his protestations of innocence, compared Wozniak's character as a witness, and his statements and acts, with the character of Herrmann as a witness, and his statements and acts, in a manner that was unfavorable to Herrmann (Decs, and Ops., p. 975).e The Commission stated that Wozniak was a crank, in a way smart, although naïve, and so smart that it was hard to believe, if he desired to start the fire, that he would have started it at his own bench and would have behaved as he did after the fire. The Commission expressed the belief that Wozniak was never in Mexico, that the letters he wrote the Russian Embassy before the fire were not a blind, but were exactly such letters as Wozniak would compose, and that he really was at heart a Russian and intended to go to Russia ; and that he was shocked at the carelessness and corruption at the Kingsland plant; and the Commission concluded that, without relying on the honesty of his statement, he seemed to act and talk like a man who was really innocent in respect to the fire; and, therefore, in spite of Herrmann's confession, it was stated that the evidence in the Kingsland case had convinced the Commission that Wozniak did not set the Kingsland fire. The Commission did say, however, that " Wozniak's description of the starting of the fire bears some resemblance to what might Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 89.</p>

<p>281 have happened if a pencil had been used ", but that, " the resemblance is not close enough to make us suspect that a pencil was actually used". (Decs, and Ops., p. 977.) * A thorough examination of the whole record, both that which was made before the decision at Hamburg and that which has been adduced since that decision, will establish the fact that Wozniak is crafty, cunning, treacherous, and rapacious. One cannot read and digest the record without coming to the conclusion that, in his greed for money, he would go to any length, and that the sentiments of loyalty and patriotism have no lodgment in his breast. In their stead, he has the instincts of the blackmailer and the heart of the typical gangster and double-crosser, and is accustomed to laugh at those whose distress he has caused. He has shown himself to be a man who is feared and suspected by his associates and whose only fear is of the penitentiary and the gallows. Herrmann, in the celebrated message, disclosed that he knew Wozniak's psychology when he wrote : " Has Hinsch seen Wozniak. Tell him to fix that up." On the same day that the affidavit of Wozniak was filed (Ger. Ex. CXXXI), the German Agent filed a motion praying that that Exhibit might be made a part of the record, and representing to the Commission that, in preparing the same, " Wozniak was not only prompted by the earnest wish to clear his name and to defend himself, on his own accord and as an individual, of the charges brought against him — charges which he resents as unfounded and as based on false tes- timony, — but also by the wish to be helpful to the Commission in finding the truth." The German Agent represents to the Commission that the whole of this Exhibit was written down by Wozniak, without any collaboration or assistance from anybody, but that his imperfect English had been corrected as to ortho- graphy and spelling by the German Agent's counsel. The German Agent represents further that, in presenting this affidavit, the German Agent was prompted by a two-fold motive: First, that he is of opinion that Wozniak's statements "are of great evidential value in the present case;" Second, that, as Wozniak had no other opportunity of defending his name, he should be given this opportunity. The German Agent also points out that while he was thoroughly convinced of the truth of Wozniak's presentation of the facts, he does not identify himself with the arguments set forth and the opinions voiced by him in his statements. Therefore, in spite of his knowledge of Wozniak's character as disclosed by the blackmail and hold-up letters, the German Agent stands behind this blackmailer and guarantees the " truth of Wozniak's presentation of the facts ". It is interesting to note that Wozniak later denominated, as a " very well polished lie ", the affidavit of the German Agent's counsel describing the circumstances under which Wozniak's original affidavits were obtained (Ger. Ex. LXXXIX a, c &amp; d). He also said that he was ashamed of himself for having signed his original affidavit. In his examination before the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Wozniak stated that the affidavits which he originally made in 1929 were not true, and he admitted that he was willing to make a false affidavit to assist Germany in defeating the claim because he thought it was a private claim r Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 90.</p>

<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>and not a case of the United States Government (Ex. 977. Ann. BB Exam, of May 3, 1937. pp. 3. 4). In view of this history, we may safely conclude that Wozniak's affidavit has not " cleared his name " nor been " helpful to the Commission in finding the truth ". In the course of his oral argument at Washington, 1932. the German Agent read into the record the copy of his letter to the American Agent dated February 10, 1932, replying to a letter of the American Agent dated February, 2. 1932, relating to a Motion filed by the latter for the oral examination of several witnesses, including Wozniak. One of the grounds asserted for examining Wozniak was that there was serious danger that Wozniak might leave the country in the near future. In the German Agent's letter (Oral Argument. 1932, p. 128) the following language is used: " With respect to this matter I wish to advise you that I have no information whatsoever as to the present whereabouts of Theodore J. Wozniak or as to any intention on his part, to leave the United States. The last conference I had with Theodore J. Wozniak was at the end of April 1931. Since that time I have received from Wozniak only one letter, dated August 13, 1931, in which he asked me to return to him certain original documents all of which were filed by me with the Commission, with the exception of some private letters. " When I returned to this country at the end of March, 1931, I had several conversations with Wozniak. In these conversations he indicated very strongly that he expected payment of a large sum of money by us. I advised Wozniak that no such payment could be made. Wozniak repeated his request at every conversation I had with him and, finally, advised me that if his request was not complied with, he would accept an offer which had been made to him and which would cause me great regret. I, thereupon, broke off my relations with Wozniak and have not seen him since." (Emphasis supplied.) By reading this letter, the German Agent brought before the Commission the fact that Wozniak was making demands for money and had been repudiated by Germany as a witness. Of course, this part of the letter was not argument, but pure testimony. It was, in the last analysis, a self-serving declaration, not under oath, coming from an attorney representing one of the parties. Later, in the oral argument, in describing his examination of Wozniak in 1929, the German Agent represented (again testifying) that, while Wozniak was in Washington, he informed Wozniak that of course he would be compen- sated for his out-of-pocket expenses and loss of time, but Wozniak stated this could no,t be done and declined to take even this compensation, to which as a witness he was entitled (Oral Argument at Washington, 1932. p. 147). The introduction of the letter above quoted, coupled with the representation that Wozniak refused to take the compensation to which as a witness he was entitled, and the refusal of the German Agent to allow W'ozniak to be examined, enabled the German Agent to argue that, as Wozniak's testimony given in 1929 was not purchased, therefore it was reliable, and to insinuate that any future testimony favorable to the United States, would be unreliable, since it would come as a result of the acceptance of an offer made to him (Oral Argu- ment at Washington, 1932, pp. 147, 148). Immediately after quoting his letter to the American Agent, the German Agent, in his oral argument, used the following language (p. 129): " In view of some of the statements made by the American Agent in his argu- ment, I desire to say that I have not seen Wozniak since April, 1931. I have not been in contact with this witness at all. The last conversation took place toward the end of April, 1931, when I refused to pay that witness what he expected, and when he threatened me that he would accept an offer.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>283 " We know now, from the recent evidence filed by the American Agent, that on May 27, 1931, a month after my last conversation with Wozniak, the so-called Wozniak letters were produced and were submitted by Baran to Mr. Peto of the Canadian Car and Foundry Company. " In view of these facts, it is clear that the German Government could not consent to the oral examination of this witness before the Commission." (Emphasis supplied.) We know that on the 25th of April, 1931, just after Wozniak had cashed an order from the German Agent on the German Consulate General for $500. Tannenberg replied to Wozniak's registered letter, which had not been intro- duced in evidence, asking for an appointment on the 28th; but it is certain, as has already been indicated in this opinion, that, whatever demand Wozniak made at that time, it was not of a different character from that which started before July 15, 1929, and was pressed with considerable vigor both orally and in letters to Wozniak. We also know that the German Agent's refusal to pay additional money did not take place until after April 25, 1931, when Wozniak got his last $500; and it is certain that the occasion of this payment was brought about by the fact that Wozniak informed the German Agent that he had an offer to sell his information to an American magazine. Wozniak testified that it was given him by the German Agent as evidence that Germany was " going to be good to him." The German Agent, by innuendo, would lead the Commission to believe that the offer which Wozniak had it in his mind to accept had a direct relation to the co-called Wozniak letters, whereas the actual offer was the offer received by Wozniak from Bishop to sell his story to an American magazine. It has been established in the course of this opinion that the Commission, in rendering the Hamburg decision, was ignorant of the following facts relating to Wozniak: First, that the matter of his compensation had been the subject of conversa- tions and letters between himself and representatives of Germany before his testimony was filed; Second, that in the course of these letters he had made threats amounting to blackmail ; Third, that he had been assured by the German Agent that Healy was mistaken in informing Wozniak that his compensation would be limited to witness' fees and expenses; Fourth, that Wozniak's total compensation paid by Germany exceeded $2,000.00; Fifth, that none of the above circumstances were brought to the attention of the Commission or were known by the Commission. After the decision at Hamburg and after the German Agent had broken with Wozniak, Wozniak was examined under subpoena issued under the Act of June 7, 1933, 48 Stat. 117 (Ex. 977, Anns. A-B) : also by agents of the Department of Justice (Ex. 998, Ann. J (a) ) ; and before the Immigration and Naturalization Service of the United States Department of Labor upon his application for naturalization (Ex. 977, Ann. BB). Upon these examinations he made statements directly contradicting his testimony produced at The Hague : (a) As to the letters to the Russians; (b) As to the post card to the Russians; (c) As to his relations with German saboteurs; (d) As to his acquaintanceship and relations with Hinsch and Herrmann, acknowledged saboteurs; and (e) As to his knowledge beforehand that the explosion at Kingsland would occur.</p>
<p>284</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>If the Commission at Hamburg had been cognizant of the facts set out in the above summary, is it conceivable that the Commission would have put more faith in Wozniak's evidence than it did in Herrmann's, and would have found that, as to the fire at Kingsland, Wozniak's words and acts were those of an innocent man? (2) Lyndhurst Testimony In discussing the cause of the Kingsland fire and after giving a short descrip- tion of the circumstances connected with the origin of that fire, the Commission at Hamburg said (Decs, and Ops., p. 976) : B " If we were called upon to guess what caused the fire from the evidence of the circumstances, we should without hesitation turn to the machine which held the shell which Wozniak was cleaning. There is strongly persuasive evidence that these machines required constant watching, that when out of order they squeaked and threw out sparks, and that fires, quickly extinguished, had previously occurred from this source, and there is some evidence from a workman close by of squeakintr and of sparks from Wozniak's machine just at the time of the starting of the fire. Wozniak himself does not mention this in his contemporaneous statements, though he later mentioned it merely as a possible explanation. In fact he says that his machine was running well that day, though it had sometimes run very hot. To Wozniak the fire seemed to originate in the rapidly revolving shellcase itself and to follow the rag wound around a stick with which he was drying the shellcase when he withdrew the rag. It is interesting to find that his own statement is the only one which bears any resemblance to what would have happened if he had used one of the inflammatory pencils with which Herrmann says he supplied him." All of the circumstances related in regard to the machines, to-wit, that they required constant watching, that when out of order they squeaked and threw out sparks, and that fires had previously occurred from this source and been quickly extinguished and that there was some evidence from a workman close by of squeaking and of sparks from Wozniak's machine just at the time of the starting of the fire, came from testimony which was taken at Lyndhurst and filed immediately before the argument at The Hague. Since the Hamburg decision, many affidavits have been filed which throw great doubt upon the accuracy of this testimony. It is the purpose of this portion of the opinion to examine the contention of the American Agent that these affidavits were false and fraudulent, and induced by a promise of a pecuniary reward. On August 9, 1930, Germany filed as German Exhibit CXV the affidavit of Domenico LaScola, taken before John R. Ruggiero, notary public, in the presence of T. J. Healy, counsel for the German Agent, and John W. Guidetti&gt; Commissioner of Streets, who acted as interpreter, the deposition being given by LaScola in the Italian language and interpreted by Guidetti; also as German Exhibit CXVI the affidavit of John R. Ruggiero sworn to before R. M. Mar- rone, notary public, and, as German Exhibit CXVII, the affidavit of Eugene Whichel Urciuoli, sworn to before R. M. Marrone, notary public. LaScola testified that he was working in the building about ten feet away from where the fire started, taking the shells from the truck and putting them on a table which was not a cleaning table; that the fire broke out at the last cleaning table from the main entrance, and then he states as follows (Ger. Ex. CXV, p. 7) : " I was working at the table, putting shells on it. The first thing I noticed was a kind of creaking noise coming from the last machine on that row of tables. The g Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 90.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>285 last machine was making some kind of a noise. I looked up and I saw spots of fire on the table, at the last machine on that row of tables. " Q.- Would you call them sparks? " A. It was sparks of fire I saw on the table. From a small fire it increased to a large fire; each of these little sparks increased to large sparks on the table and some of the men took rags and tried to smother the fire and the rags were soaked with benzine. " Q.. Then what happened? " A. The boss ' Tom ' was in the toilet and when he heard there was a fire, he came out and ' Tom ' told a man to get a pail of water and when I heard ' Tom ' ask for a pail of water, I ' made feet ' and ran because I thought something was going to happen. " Q. At the beginning of the fire did you see the sparks coming from a cleaning machine? " A. I heard the squeaking of the machine and that is what attracted my attention. Then I looked and saw the sparks on the table." He was also asked if he had ever heard any of the cleaning machines squeak- ing before the day of the fire. He answered: " Yes, sir, and this man Eugene used to stop them immediately and used to oil them." (id. p. 8) He also said that when the fire started the man at the table " got rags so that he could smother it, to stop the fire." (id. p. 9) LaScoIa in this same deposition is represented as testifying as follows: " Q_. What is your opinion as to how the fire started? " A. I don't know. I saw those sparks and that is all I saw. " Q.. Do you think that the sparks came from the cleaning machine? " A. Yes, it came from that machine. " Q.- That is what you thought at that time? " A. As I saw those sparks on the table I didn't think of anything. I started to run. " Q. How big were the sparks when you first saw them? " A. First they were small sparks and then they started spreading. When they started to beat them with rags they got larger. " Q,. Did the man at whose machine the fire started try to put out the fire? " A. Yes, he took rags right from the table and tried to smother the fire with them. There were others who threw rags on the fire, too. " Q.- When you first saw the sparks, were they on the table? " A. They were on the table. " Q,. Did the machine keep on squeaking when you saw the sparks? " A. No, they stopped all the machines and shut off the motors at the same time the fire started." (id. pp. 10, 11) Under date of April 26, 1933, an affidavit in the Italian language was obtained from LaScola throwing considerable light on the circumstances under which Mr. Healy, whom he describes an " as American ", obtained the depo- tition (Ger. Ex. CXV). The pertinent parts of this affidavit read in translation as follows : " In the summer of 1930 there came to my house a man, * * * and asked me if I was Domenico La Scola, and replying that I was, and that I did not under- stand English, told me if he could bring Mr. John Guidetti as an interpreter, and returned at the hour of 5 p.m. with Mr. G. Guidetti and Ruggiero, and this man, an American, asked me all the questions through the Mr. Guidetti, and the American wrote with a pencil, and I told him everything regarding the fire, and after all had left, the American said he would return that night. At about 11 p.m. the American returned alone, knocked on my door, and I got of bed and went to see who it was, he extended his hand, and after turning around to leave, I found in my hand $50.</p>
<p>286</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>" The next day, at night, came the Mr. Ruggiero with a statement typewritten, with a few pages, and asked me to sign, but I did not read it because I could not read English. " After six or seven months G. Ruggiero came and brought me another $50, and after another three or four months Mr. Carella sent me another S50 through my son, Salvatore. " This is all the money I received, but the American promised me that he was going to pay all expenses regarding my operation, but I did not see him again, after he had promised to pay me good. " At the time of the fire I was about ten feet away and out of the corner of my eye I saw a small flame f" una piccola flamma "] and saw the man with a rag saturated in benzine try to put out fire with it but instead caused the flame to spread and increase, and another man threw a pail of water on the flames spreading them more and then everybody ran, and this is all, and I told others the same thing, and everybody who asked me." (Ex. 980, Anns. D and E.) In the same affidavit LaScola makes the following explanation as to the use of the word " sparks " described as coming from the machine as set out in German Exhibit CXV. pp. 9 and 10: " I was working in Building No. 30 about six months and never saw any fires. " I was told that the statement I signed three years ago for the American who came with Guidetti and Ruggiero, that the machine threw sparks [" la scintilla " ] , but I did not make this statement and it is not true that this machine threw sparks [" la scintilla " ] . " (Ex. 980, Anns. D and E.) That the machines did not throw out sparks is likewise testified to by Wozniak both before and after the Hamburg decision. See Wozniak's affidavit of August 11, 1930 (Ger. Ex. CXXXI, Ann. F, p. 2) ; statement of March 3, 1931, at Hotel Roosevelt (Ex. 977, Ann. C, p. 7); and affidavit of January 12, 1934, to Department of Justice (Ex. 998, Ann. J (a), pp. 11, 12). Ruggiero, in German Exhibit CXVI, testified that he was employed at the Kingsland plant a few months after the plant was put into operation (p. 1) and that he quit work in December, 1916, because he considered that the work was not being conducted with the proper regard for the safety of the men and the plant (p. 5); that the immediate occasion of his quitting was a defective electric motor which ran hot and on occasion emitted sparks which would have caused a fire had it not been for the fact that a piece of metal had been placed between the motor and the floor; that he called attention of the proper persons to this and he finally quit because he felt he could not be res- ponsible for the safety of the plant and the lives of the men. He also testified (p. 3) that during the course of his employment in Building No. 30 he frequently saw machines throw sparks as a result of friction developing from defects in the machines. He was asked a long hypothetical question which assumed that the machine was squeaking at the time the fire started and that sparks were seen blowing or burning upon the table at the inception of the fire. That Ruggiero was not telling the truth when he said in his affidavit of August 4, 1930, that: " I quit work in December, 1916, because I considered that the work was not being conducted with the proper regard for the safety of the men and of the plant.' (Ger. Ex. CXVI, p. 5) is conclusively established by Ruggiero's own statement found in his report to the German Agent in which he says that he left " the employ of the Canadian Car &amp; Foundry Company some three or four months before the fire " (Ex. 980, Ann. B, Ex. A attached). The above-quoted statement from Ruggiero's report to the German Agent (rather than his contrary statement found in his affidavit of August 4, 1930)</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>287 is confirmed by the payrolls of the company that show the only Ruggiero employed in the second half of 1916 was employed under the name F. Ruggiero who appeals on the payroll for July 31 - August 6, 1916, as No. 2276 (Ex. 770, Ann. 2). He subsequently appears under No. 1652 on the payrolls for the weeks beginning August 7, 14, and 21, the last day with which he was credited as working being August 26, 1916 (id. Anns. 2a, 2b, and 2c). His name was also carried on the payrolls for the weeks beginning August 28, and Septem- ber 4, 1916. during which time he was not credited with working (id. Anns. 2d and 2e). A careful examination of the payrolls of the company fails to disclose the name of Ruggiero as appearing after September 4, 1916. Urciuoli in Exhibit CXVII testified (p. 1) that he was employed at the Kings- land plant and began work there when the Company started construction of the plant and continued work until the fire, and after the fire he was carried on the payroll of the Company for two weeks. He testified that it was his duty to take care of the machines, to see that they were properly oiled, etc., and that he always kept the pulleys well oiled (p. 3) : " because otherwise the machine would get hot and begin to squeak as a result of friction. If this friction continued, the pulley would begin to throw sparks. During the time that I was employed in Building No. 30, hardly a day went by without some of the cleaning machines sparking from this cause. * * * it was impossible to prevent these machines from sparking. * * * I urged Master Mechanic Hopper and the building foreman, Tomlinson, to have these cast iron pulleys replaced with fibre pulleys, but no attention was ever paid to this request." He reiterates several times that a hot spark would be thrown from the mach- ines and could be seen from the center of the building and that when these sparks occurred he would hurry to the machine and throw the belt off, and that during the time he was employed in Building No. 30 one of the tables caught fire from this cause, namely, the sparking of the cleaning machine, and he put it out •with an overcoat. He was asked the same hypothetical question as was asked Ruggiero and gave the same answer (p. 4). Urciuoli's affidavit shows that he was not present in Building No. 30 at all during the week of the fire; that his father's funeral, which he was attending, •was stopped by the fire. Marrone, the notary public, before whom were executed the affidavits of Urciuoli and Ruggiero, stated that after the affidavits were executed, he heard that much money was paid to the witnesses for their statements, and that three of the people who had made affidavits for the German Government told him that they had received various sums for their affidavits (Ex. 980, Ann. A). There is set out below correspondence between Nicholas A. Carella, a lawyer in Lyndhurst, and Dr. Wilhelm Tannenberg: " April 10, 1931.

<p>(Ex. 980, Ann. B, Ex. L, attached.) (Emphasis supplied.) "April 17, 1931. " Nicholas A. Carella, Esq. 298 Ridge Road Lyndhurst, N. J. " Dear Sir: " I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant and your tele- gram of today. I have to apologize for not answering your letter promptly; however, I postponed my reply for the reason that the instructions from Germany for which I had asked had not yet arrived and I was anxious to advise you that our conversation had been confirmed. " The unexpected delay was due to the fact that I was requested to supply our Berlin office with detailed information which was required in order to enable them to proceed as suggested by me. That does not mean that there are any obstacles. / have no doubt that the instructions will be here by Monday of next week (April 20th) at the very latest, and I shall not fail to inform you immediately as to when you can go to New York. " I sincerely hope that you will understand the situation and that the unfore- seen delay will not have caused you any inconveniences. I also hope that I shall have an opportunity to see you again in the near future so that I can explain to you the circumstances in more detail. " You may rest assured that I greatly appreciate your services and that I am awaiting your reports with great interest. " Your very truly, " Wilhelm Tannenberg." (id., Ex. M) (Emphasis supplied.) On April 20, 1931, Dr. Tannenberg wrote to Carella a letter, the body of which reads as follows: " Referring to my letter of the 17th inst. and to my telegram of the following day, I wish to advise you that I have received authority to proceed in the matter as suggested. If you will be kind enough to call at the German Consulate General in New York, Mr. Loerky, the gentleman whom you met there on a previous occasion, will give you the necessary information." (id. Ex. N.) (Emphasis supplied.) The " authority to proceed " and " the necessary information " was, of course, funds which Mr. Loerky was going to pay to Carella when he called at the German Consulate General in New York. Carella had been retained by Tannenberg or Healy to obtain the Lyndhurst affidavits. From the investigation and report which is attached to Exhibit 980, Annex B, Ex. (b) it is represented to Dr. Tannenberg as follows: " I am pleased to report through our efforts the witnesses openly and unquali- fiedly refused to sign any statements but they approached me and informed me that they are holding me to the promise that I had made to them namely, that they will receive some pecuniary advantage after the case has been finally adjudicated." (p. 2) (Emphasis supplied.) And in the same paper referring to Whichel (Urciuoli) we find the following statement : " Dui to the promise that Mr. Healy made to him to wit: that he will receive a pecuniary advantage after the case has been finally adjudicated. Mr. Whichell refused to make any adverse statements against the German Government pertaining to the matter in dispute." (p. 2) (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

<p>289 German Annex 103 is the affidavit of Thomas J. Healy, dated the 13th day of April, 1935, and filed the 16th day of April, 1935. He was an attorney associated with the German Agent making investigations as to the origin of the fires at Kingsland and Black Tom. He explains the circumstances under which he met LaScoIa and secured from him through his grandson as interpreter a promise to give an affidavit in regard to the Kingsland fire. He secured the services of Guidetti as interpreter and through him the services of Ruggiero as notary, and he relates the circumstances under which LaScola's affidavit was procured as follows: After securing LaScola's affidavit he then took the testi- mony of Ruggiero and Whichel (Urciuoli). He paid Ruggiero $20 for his services in taking the testimony of LaScoIa, and $75 for investigations, and $20 on another occasion. He paid Whichel $15 for his services as an expert witness and Marrone $30 for his services as notary. He also took $50 to La- Scola's house. He made no further payments, nor did he make any promises of further payments in event that Germany was successful, nor did he give any promises nor hold out any hopes of any further payments or rewards to these witnesses. He then continues : " Carella informed me that although all possible pressure was being brought to bear upon these witnesses they had steadfastly declined to modify in any way their previous testimony as given to me. From Carella's statements it appeared particularly that the Claimants were trying to induce these witnesses to testify that they had seen or knew of the use of incendiary pencils in connection with the fire at Kingsland. Mr. Carella urged that in view of the necessitous circum- stances of these witnesses and the temptation to which they were being exposed by the offers of the Claimants' representatives to deviate from their prior testimony, some payment should be made to them. I paid Mr. Carella the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars at that time for his previous professional services with the understanding that out of this sum he was to pay Ruggiero, Whichel and Lascola a small amount each. My recollection is that I was later informed that he had paid each of them fifty dollars. My recollection is that this payment to Carella was made in the latter part of December, 1930." (Ger. Ann. 103) (Emphasis supplied.) Victor Frangipane, another Lyndhurst witness, whose August, 1930, state- ment was not filed until 1937, and then only on request, testifies that he was paid S50 at the time his statement was taken down, another $50 at the time he signed the statement and that Carella promised him that if Germany won the case he would get not less than $500 (Ex. 980, Ann. F). In response to a request by the American Commissioner on the 28th day of June, 1937, the German Agent on January 7, 1938, filed German Annex 142 with ten exhibits. In his sworn statement of January 7, 1938, submitting parts of documents requested, the German Agent states as follows: " Mr. Nicholas Carella, an attorney at law of New Jersey who had been retained by Mr. Healy in connection with the procuring of evidence at Lyndhurst late in July and in August 1930 asked for the payment of fees for his own services and also for some moneys for payments to witnesses at Lyndhurst in order to prevent them from giving false testimony to representatives of the claimants. * * * * Mr. Loerky also transmitted to Mr. Carella the two payments of $1000.— and $1500.—; the Consulate General [New York] as such sent to Berlin directly Mr. Carella's receipt for the first payment made on or about April 21, 1931. * * * ." (Emphasis supplied.) Exhibit A is a telegram dated April 18, 1931, from Washington to the Foreign Office, Berlin, for authorization for payment of $1,500 indicating a written report would follow.

<p>" Carella a who is continuing to counteract energetically in order to prevent the witnesses from giving false testimony, will make a circumstantial report concerning the2 methods of our opponents' agents, however, he has a difficult position * * *. In order to be in a position to go on meeting effectively the intrigues which are allegedly also supported by Federal Judge Fake, Carella requests most urgently S1000.—, the more so, since various witnesses are apparently prepared to accept the offers of our opponents. After conference with C. I consider it as indispensable and as harmless that he continues his activities and that the requested moneys be paid." (Emphasis supplied.) (This telegram seems not to have been sent.) Exhibit C is a telegram, dated April 20, 1931, from Dieckhoff for the Am- bassador in Washington, personally, reading as follows: " The Embassy is hereby given authorization to make available 1500 Dollars." Exhibit D is a deleted telegram, dated May 1, 1931, from Tannenberg to the Foreign Office, attention of Dieckhoff, indicating that he has paid $1,000 to Carella as fee for his past and future services for the German Agency and as reimbursement of his disbursements. The exhibit has the following deletions which evidently relate to the payment of money in the sabotage claims, referring to the " authorization to pay an amount of SI ,500 for the purposes of the sabotage cases " : " Thereupon I have made the following payments out of this amount: . . .[sic] . . .[sic] . . .[sic] (2) S 1,000 to Carella, * * *. I beg to give the following reasons for these payments: . . .[sic] . . .[sic] . . .[sic] (2) Carella." The exhibit refers to the alleged attempt on the part of the claimants " to induce our witnesses as well as other former workmen of the Kingsland plant by promises of compensations to represent the former depositions of our witnesses as inaccurate and to discredit Mr. Healy's work at Lyndhurst. * * * Carella emphasized that his further efforts of frustrating the obtaining of false depositions discrediting us would only be successful if funds were made available to him, from which he could pay his agents for their work. Furthermore, it would be necessary for him to be in a position occasionally to pay smaller amounts to other people. * * * " To cover these and future obligations and as fee for his work done so far and to be done in the future and for the work of his agents Carella asked for an amount of at least S 1,000. * * * In view of the extraordinary importance which the state- ments of our witnesses at Lyndhurst had in connection with the decision in the Kingsland case and in view of the great danger that would arise should the agents of claimants succeed in procuring the testimony desired by them / consider the continuation of Carella's services at Lyndhwst as indispensable." (Emphasis supplied.) Exhibit E is a deleted telegram, dated December 14, 1931, from Prittwitz to the Foreign Office in which he makes a request for S 1,500 for a final fee for Carella and S400 for reimbursement for expenditures for Carella. He states as reasons for his request that 1 The wording of this telegram would indicate that Carella was well known to the Foreign Office. 2 Report here referred to may be the one at Ex. 980, Ex.

<p>291 " Healy had promised to him [CareUa] a special fee, if his services would be successful. 1 From my conference with Carclla I have reached the conviction that the payment of the moneys requested is indispensable to keep C. and his people in line. I therefore request authorization by cable to pay S1900.— from funds above referred to." (Emphasis supplied.) Exhibit F is a deleted telegram, dated December 18, 1931, signed DieckhofF reading as follows: " For Agent " You are authorized to pay to Carella . . . [sic] up to nineteen hundred (1900) Dollars." These telegrams show that in addition to the payments referred to by Healy as made these witnesses in 1930 (Ger. Ann. 103), further payments to the extent of $3,400 were authorized in April and December, 1931. The principal purpose for which the affidavits of LaScola, Ruggiero and Urciuoli were filed was to convince the Commission that the cause of the Kingsland disaster was a defective condition of the machines which threw out sparks and caused the gasoline to ignite. It has been established that these affidavits were purchased and paid for, and that, after the affidavits were filed, Germany authorized further payments to the extent of at least $3,400, to keep these witnesses bought and in line. This in itself is sufficient to show that the Commission at Hamburg was misled by purchased and perjured testimony; but the evidence which has been adduced since Hamburg establishes beyond doubt that the machine before which Wozniak was working had never sparked, that none of the machines in the room had ever emitted a spark or had ever been in the faulty condition described by the three bought affidavits. The essential falsity of these affidavits was established before the Commission at Washington in May, 1936, by the exhibiting and operating of a replica of one of the machines. It would seem clear that, if the Commission at Hamburg had had before it the evidence " autoptically proffered " at Washington, and had been con- scious of the fact that the Lyndhurst testimony had been bought and paid for, and that the witnesses producing it would still remain on Germany's payroll after the decision at Hamburg, the Commission could not have stated, as it did at Hamburg, that there was strongly persuasive evidence that these mach- ines required constant watching, that when out of order they squeaked and threw out sparks and that fires quickly extinguished had previously occurred from this source. It will be recalled in this connection that Wozniak himself has always denied that his machine was in bad order or that it squeaked or threw out sparks (Ex. 726, Ex. 4, p. 4885; Ger. Ex. CXXXI, Ann. G, p. 2; Ex. 977, Ann. C, p. 7; Ex. 998 J (a), pp. 11, 12). This being true, it seems clear that the decision at Hamburg, without any reference to Wozniak's testimony, must be reaxamined on the question of the cause of the Kingsland disaster. (3) Purpose of affidavits of Ahrendt. Hmsch and Woehst There are three German witnesses whose affidavits were introduced for similar purposes, Ahrendt, Hinsch and Woehst. An examination of the various affidavits filed by these witnesses will show that the first purpose for which their affidavits were filed was to bolster up the affidavits of Marguerre, Nadolny, von Papen, and Bernstoff, and thus to give additional strength to the German 1 Healy in his affidavit of April 13, 1935, denied making any payments to witnesses in addition to those made by him in August, 1930 (Ger. Ann. 103).</p>
<p>292</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>pleadings that sabotage was never authorized in the United States during neutrality. The second purpose for which these affidavits were introduced was to disprove the confessions by Hilken and Herrmann : the confession of Hilken to the effect that he was the banker for various German saboteurs in this country; supplied them with funds; helped to equip them; and paid out money as compensation for the destruction of Black Tom and Kingsland; the con- fession of Herrmann, that he together with Hinsch, was responsible for the organization of a band of saboteurs operating from Baltimore, New York and other cities; that he supplied these saboteurs with incendiary devices; and that they were both responsible in this way for the destruction of Kingsland and Black Tom. The affidavits of Ahrendt, Hinsch and Woehst all show this thread of design permeating their whole structure. In order to appreciate this design and purpose, it is necessary, briefly, to summarize the confessions of Hilken and Herrmann. It is now thoroughly agreed, both by the witnesses for Germany and the witnesses for the United States, that authority for sabotage was directly given to Hilken and Herrmann in a meeting with " Sektion Politik " of the German General Staff by Captains Nadolny and Marguerre in Berlin in February, 1916. Hilken's description of this meeting is found in Exhibit 771, Rec. p. 5782, and reads in part as follows : " As I previously testified I was present with Fred Herrmann and I think Anton Dilger also with Captains Nadolny and Marguerre in Berlin in February, 1916, at which time sabotage against munitions and supplies in the United States was fully discussed by us all. The incendiary tubes which were described by Fred Herrmann were handled and discussed by us at the time and our instructions were to get busy on this work immediately on our return to the United States. Fred Hinsch was discussed by us and his activities were known to Nadolny and Marguerre at that time. Herrmann was not under the authority of any one of us and I distinctly remember the high recommendation with which Herrmann had been sent to the general staff of the army by the admiralty department. 1 " In addition to the general sabotage activities in the United States, Nadolny and Marguerre urged the destruction of the Power House at Niagara Falls and also the Tampico Oil fields. * * * " The Tampico Oil Fields was quite a sore spot to Germany as Britain was obtaining large supplies from Mexico. It was urged upon me that an effort should also be made to set fire to these wells. We did nothing about it until Fred Herrmann left the United States for Mexico in February, 1917, when I reminded him of the talk of the General Staff and suggested that he report the details to Ambassador von Eckhardt. " The statement now made by Marguerre that the instructions which he gave us to destroy munitions and supplies in the United States were not to take effect until or unless the United States got into the war is wholly contrary to what actually took place. There was no suggestion whatever at that time of not com- mencing our activities unless the United States entered the war against Germany. On the contrary the prevailing opinion at that time, in January, 1916, in Berlin certainly was that the United States in all probability would not enter the war." In addition, in the same affidavit (Rec. p. 5781), Hilken tells of Rintelen's sabotage activities and of his meeting with Rintelen on a number of occasions in Baltimore and the fact that Hinsch was instructed by Rintelen in regard to incendiary devices and he further tells of the activities of Anton Dilger. 1 Hilken's letter of Jan. 11, 1917, to Arnold also refers to the fact that Woehst was sent over in the fall of 1916 by " our principals abroad " with a new supply of these incendiary devices (Ex. 976, Ann. E, pp. 50, 51).</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>293 The description given above by Hilken of the meeting with " Sektion Politik " does not differ essentially from his description given in Claimants' Exhibit 583. Rec. p. 2180, Hilken's examination by Peaslee, in December, 1928. In this latter examination Hilken was able, from his contemporaneous memorandum, to fix the exact date of this meeting as February 18, 1916. In Exhibit 583 he testified that the funds which he paid to Herrmann came out of the funds made available to him by the General Staff and that the funds which he paid to Herrmann and Hinsch probably exceeded S50,000 (Rec. p. 2187). The funds sent by him to Mexico through Hinsch, Herrmann and Dilger amounted to probably more than $100,000. The amount taken by Hinsch to Mexico was 823,361.75 (Rec. pp. 2189. 2190). He denied the statements which were attributed to Marguerre and Nadolny that the instructions to commit sabotage were to apply only if and when the United States should enter the war. He stated that at the time these instruc- tions were given there was no thought of war, nor real expectancy of war between the United States and Germany (Rec. p. 2237; also p. 5783). Herrmann's description of the meeting in Germany attended by Marguerre, Nadolny, Dilger, Hilken, and himself, does not differ in essential points from the description given by Hilken (Rec. p. 5431 et seq.). In relating the history of that meeting Herrmann gave a very accurate description of the incendiary pencils and drew a sketch showing the outer shell and the inner incendiary pencil and the two compartments; and this sketch may be found opposite Rec. p. 5444 and opposite Rec. p. 5520. He confirmed Hilken's statement that Hilken was to be the paymaster of saboteurs (Rec. p. 5446), and at this meeting Hinsch's name was brought into the conversation. Herrmann was informed in the conversation that it was safe to use these devices " because they had been doing it before " but not with these pencils (Rec. p. 5447). He met Carl Dilger and stayed with him three or four days in Washington. He fixed up the tubes and gave them to Hinsch and explained their use and Hinsch had fifteen or twenty men, including " a coon by the name of Eddie ", who used to report to him regularly. In December, 1916, he and Hinsch made up a list of plants manufacturing munitions, including the Kingsland plant (Rec. pp. 5451, 5452). As to Marguerre's affidavit claiming that sabotage in the United States was not allowed during neutrality. Herrmann said (Rec. p. 5460) : " Q.- * * * ' These instructions did not refer to acts of sabotage on American territory, as long as that country was not at war with us.' Is that true? A. That is not true; absolutely not. It is logical isn't it, that they would not spend the money to have me waiting there for years, when there was no war, and paying my expenses." (Rec. p. 5460.) (Emphasis supplied.) As to his authority to fire the Tampico Oil Fields, Herrmann testified as follows (Rec. p. 5477): " Q,. Did you suggest to Minister von Eckhardt to try to blow up the Tampico oil fields? Did you have a conversation with the Minister in regard to setting fire to the Tampico oil fields? A. To blow them up? The conversation was with the minister as to setting fire to them, and I told him that would be a hell of a hard job. " Q. You did not suggest that to him? A. I might have suggested it." (Supra. this opinion, p. 34; also Ex. 320, Rec. p. 874, and Ex. 520, Rec. p 1847.) Herrmann's description of the meeting with " Sektion Politik " is found in his examination by the two Agents on April 3, 1931 (Rec. p. 5431 et seq.). In this examination, after relating his history and his work in England for Germany at the beginning of the war, he tells of his trip abroad via Bergen to Germany and meeting Anton Dilger on the ship (id. p. 5440). Later he was introduced 20</p>
<p>294</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>to Paul Hilken by Dilger in Berlin. He and Hilken and Dilger visited the General Staff and met Marguerre and Nadolny (id. p. 5443), and entered into a discussion with Marguerre and Nadolny " about the destruction of munitions plants in the States ", and they were told about the glass tubes, how they were arranged, and how to use them. Hilken was to be paymaster (id. p. 5446-7). Herrmann was instructed to go back to the United States and to report to Hilken in Baltimore, and left about a week or two after the conversation (id. p. 5448). He was given $1,000 or SI,200, went to Baltimore to see Hilken, who introduced him to Hinsch and told him that Hinsch had been on different jobs and was using " dumplings ", but that they were not reliable (Rec. pp. 5449-50). These " dumplings " were being made by a doctor from the " Neckar " at Hinsch's house. He went from Baltimore to Washington and stayed with Carl Dilger, Anton Dilger's brother, three or four days. He showed Hinsch how to use the tubes and gave him the instructions that Herrmann had received from Germany. Herrmann first met Woehst the end of November or the first of December. Woehst had come from the General Staff to report to Hilken (Rec. p. 5451). Hinsch brought Wozniak to Herrmann at the McAlpin Hotel. Herrmann made an engagement with Wozniak to meet him at the Barclay Street ferry house and three or four days later he asked Wozniak if he could get a job for another fellow. Wozniak was a funny looking fellow, nervous and excitable, and Herr- mann got hold of Hinsch and said, " I do not like to trust this fellow with any- thing ", and he told Wozniak to come back afterwards. He met him again and spoke to Hinsch about him again and said, " I do not like the looks of this fellow." So Hinsch got him Rodriguez, and he introduced Rodriguez to Wozniak, and Wozniak said he thought he could get Rodriguez a job because he knew somebody who was doing the hiring at Kingsland. He gave Wozniak and Rodriguez incendiary pencils and paid them three or four times, $40 a week. After the fire he met Rodriguez and gave him $500, two days after the fire (id. pp. 5454, 5455). Thus it is seen that, from the testimony of Hilken and Herrmann, the author- ity given by Nadolny and Marguerre to commit sabotage was confirmed; and the testimony of Nadolny and Marguerre and the other witnesses for Ger- many, that this authority and activity were both limited to the time when the United States should enter the war, was directly contradicted by both Hilken and Herrmann. The issue, therefore, is clearly drawn as to whether Hilken and Herrmann were telling the truth, first, when they claimed that the authority gotten in Berlin was not limited to the time when America should go to war but was intended to apply to the period of America's neutrality, and, second, whether Hilken and Herrmann, operating through Hinsch and his subordinates and other saboteurs, did, in .fact, commit sabotage against American property during the neutrality of the United States. An examination of the record will now be made for the purpose of ascer- taining whether Ahrendt's affidavits may be relied on to contradict and destroy the confessions of Hilken and Herrmann. (4) Affidavits of Ahrendt Carl O. Ahrendt has testified seven times for Germany (Ger. Exs. LXVII (a); CII; Ger. Anns. 73, 74, 75, 115, and 160). As indicated above, one of the main purposes of these affidavits was to disprove the confessions of Hilken and Herrmann. Ahrendt is of German parentage but was born in America in April, 1888 (Ger. Ex. CII, p. 2). From 1905 to 1916 he was an employee of Schumacher</p>

This firm were the agents of the North German Lloyd Steamship Company and had been such agents since 1868 (Ex. 583, Rec. p. 2155). In 1916 Hilken, ST., and Paul Hilken formed the Eastern Forwarding Com- pany, of which Hilken, Sr., became President and Paul Hilken the Vice President. The purpose of the formation of this Company was to operate the line of U-boats which Germany projected sending to America, first to Baltimore and later to New London (Ger. Ex. CII, pp. 31, 32, 33). In the years 1916 and 1917, Ahrendt was assistant to Captain Hinsch and Paul Hilken (id. p. 33). When Hilken returned from Europe in March, 1916, after his conference with Marguerre and Nadolny, he introduced Herrmann to Ahrendt in the office of Schumacher and Company. Although Herrmann informed Ahrendt of his activities in England at the beginning of the war, Herrmann, according to Ahrendt, did not say anything about his activities in America or the purpose of his coming back to the United States, and Ahrendt claims not to know that he had any connection with the German Government at all (Ger. Ex. CII, pp. 63. 64, 65). Ahrendt met Captain Hinsch for the first time in the office of Schumacher and Company shortly after Hinsch brought the " Neckar ", a North German Lloyd boat, into Baltimore, in the summer of 1914 (id. pp. 36, 37). Hinsch rented a house in Baltimore and lived there with his housekeeper, who later became his wife. Hinsch remained in Baltimore from about September, 1914, to about August, 1916, when he went to New London in connection with the U-boat work, and during all of the time, Ahrendt never heard of any activities of Captain Hinsch outside of the commercial submarine activities and his duties as Master of the " Neckar ". He never heard that he had been engaged in infecting horses and mules or in sabotage against vessels or employing men to destroy munitions going to England and France (id. pp. 38, 39, 40). During that time Ahrendt saw Hinsch nearly every day, as Hinsch would come to the office of Schumacher and Company very frequently and occupied a double desk with Ahrendt. Ahrendt spent a great deal of time at Hinsch's house. Their relations were very friendly (id. pp. 40, 41). In January, 1916, Hinsch in New York phoned to Ahrendt in Baltimore requesting him to bring with him $2,000; and Ahrendt secured two one thousand dollar bills from Dederer, the Treasurer of Schumacher and Company, and took them to Hinsch in New York, although Hinsch had no account with that Company and no deposit (Ger. Ex. LXVII(a); Ex. 975, Ann.</p>

<p>pp. 26, 27, 30-40; Ex. 976, Ann. A, pp. 56, 57, 68, 74). After the United States entered the war, Hinsch fled to Mexico to evade a Presidential warrant for his arrest as an alien enemy (Ord. Ex. 343, Rec. p. 4258) ; and Ahrendt accompanied Hinsch to El Paso and helped him cross the border into Mexico (Ex. 975, Ann. C, pp. 98-104). Later in the year 1917 Ahrendt accompanied Hinsch's housekeeper to Laredo, Texas, and assisted her in crossing the border to join Hinsch in Mexico (Ex. 975, Ann. C, pp. 235 et seq.). After the war, in 1922-1923 Ahrendt lived in Hilken's apartment on West 71st Street, New York, and Herrmann visited them there (Ex. 975, Ann. C. pp. 165, 167) ; and in 1922, through the aid of Paul Hilken, Ahrendt entered the employ of the North German Lloyd. He had previously been employed since 1919 by Hilken in the automobile tire sales business and in the motortruck business. (Ger. Ex. LXVII (a)). 1 Examination of Ahrendt under subpoena by the American Agent.</p>

<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>The short history of Ahrendt's relations with Paul Hilken, Hinsch and Herr- mann bears out Ahrendt's claim that he was an intimate associate of theirs in 1916 and 1917, so intimate that if they were connected with sabotage acti- vities in this country during this period, Ahrendt's acquaintanceship with them should have made him fully aware of such activities. In order to support Hinsch's claim that he did not engage in sabotage in the United States subsequent to the beginning of the commercial submarine activity, Ahrendt testified that Hinsch was in Baltimore, actively engaged in preparation for the reception of the " U-Deutschland "; was in fact during this period only away for a day or so at a time between the return of Hilken in the latter part of March, 1916. and the arrival of the '" Deutschland " early in July, 1916 (Ger. Ex. CII, pp. 40,41.46); that while the "Deutschland" was in Baltimore Hinsch was not away at all (id. pp. 47-49) ; and that Hinsch was in New London practically all of the time from August, 1916, when the commercial submarine business was transferred from Baltimore to New London, until shortly after the United States entered the war (id. pp. 53-55). During this latter period Ahrendt claims to have seen Hinsch " every day excepting when he would go and take a short run to Baltimore or to New York " on which trips he " would never be " away " over two or three days " (id. p. 56). During December. 1916, following the departure of the " Deutschland " from New London, and January, 1917, Hinsch. according to Ahrendt, " was busy getting ready for the next submarine " (id. p. 58). While Ahrendt is not at all certain that Hinsch was away from New London some time before Christmas in December, 1916 (id. p. 60), Metzler, a fellow employee at New London with Ahrendt, is certain that Hinsch was away from New London for a few days " either in the middle of December or towards the end of December [1916], around the 20th or so." This absence of Hinsch from New London was before Christmas, 1916 (Ger. Ex. XCVIII, pp. 79, 80). Under examination by the American Agent (Ex. 875, Ann. C) Ahrendt contradicted his previous testimony when he stated that in November, 1916, after going to Baltimore he came back to New London about a week after Thanksgiving and remained in New London until February, 1917; that they had nothing to do in New London at that time; that Hinsch was there; he saw him practically every day; that Hinsch did not go away very often but he did go either to Baltimore or New York (id. pp. 156-158, 183). In a letter written October 2, 1916, while they were awaiting the arrival of the " Deutschland" in New London, Hilken informs Salzer, Chief Clerk in the office of A. Schumacher and Company, as follows: " * * * during the last two weeks I might have helped you and been happy to have had something to do. This ' watchful waiting ' game is getting more than monotenous." (Ex. 976, Ann. A-D, p. 253, Ex. 51 attached.) And in a letter dated October 18, 1916, Salzer wrote to Ahrendt, c/o Eastern Forwarding Company at New London, as follows: " I presume that you will have plenty of time to get up a scrap book for Captain Hinsch, as there is a long time between sailings of the U-boats." (id. p. 254, Ex. 49 attached.) The " Deutschland " actually arrived on November 1, 1916; and these two letters prove conclusively that, during the time of" watchful waiting", there was no necessity for Hinsch to remain continuously on the job at New London. When Hinsch fled from the United States to Mexico in order to evade a Presidential warrant for his arrest, Ahrendt accompanied him to El Paso and assisted him in getting across the border (Ger. Ann. 74; Ger. Ex. CII, pp. 84-91 ; Ex. 975. Ann. C. pp. 98-108) ; and subsequently Ahrendt accompanied Hinsch's</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>297 housekeeper (later to become his wife) to Laredo (Ex. 975. Ann. C, pp. 235-238). Ahrendt claimed that after Hinsch arrived in Mexico he had one letter telling about his arrival and that that was the only letter he had from him; that Hinsch did not tell him what he was doing in Mexico nor did anyone else inform him about Hinsch's activities in Mexico. He understood Hinsch was simply living there because it was a country which was neutral (Ger. Ex. CII,</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">P. 92).</h3>
<p>After the Herrmann Message was produced, Ahrendt was examined with regard to letters written with secret inks (Ger. Ann. 75. filed August 15, 1932). He then testified that he received from Dr. Dilger, who had returned to the United States on July 4, 1917 (Ex. 943), instructions as to how to write with the new fluid and how to develop the secret writing. Some time after this incident a letter was received from Hinsch, intended for Paul Hilken and Hilken turned it over to Ahrendt to develop. After he developed the letter, he found that it was a secret message concerning certain supplies which Hinsch needed for a wireless station which he wanted to build in Mexico. Thus we have Ahrendt contradicting himself when he stated in his first affidavit that he never heard from anybody what Hinsch was doing in Mexico. It is pertinent to note that Ahrendt assisted Hilken in writing a secret mes- sage to Hinsch answering the prior secret message (Ger. Ann. 75, p. 4). This incident is confirmed by Hilken's examination in September, 1933 (Ex. 976, Ann. E, pp. 8 to 10). See also examination of Ahrendt, Exhibit 975, Ann. C, pp. 210, et seg., where Ahrendt denies that his development of the secret message from Hinsch in Mexico to Hilken, requesting material for the wireless, was the act of a spy; but he excused himself on the ground that he was a misguided youth (of over 29 years (Ger. Ex. CII, p. 2) ), and should have had better sense. He also admitted that there was a second letter received (Ex. 975, Ann. C. p. 214). a short time after the first one (id. p. 213), and that he developed the same and gave it to Mr. Hilken (id. p. 216). At the time that he developed the second letter he was not working for Hilken but for the Old Bay Line (id. p. 217). When we take into consideration the close association between Ahrendt and Hinsch, Ahrendt's denial of any knowledge of Hinsch's activities is, to say the least, remarkable. Ahrendt knew Hinsch while Ahrendt was an em- ployee of A. Schumacher and Company, and he testified that he was a deskmate and close companion of Hinsch throughout Hinsch's connection with the Hilkens in Baltimore, and he saw Hinsch almost every day from 1914 to 1917 (Ger. Ex. CII, p. 40). One of the main purposes for which German Exhibit CII was introduced was to prove that Ahrendt had never heard or known of sabotage being con- ducted by Herrmann or Hinsch with disease germs, bombs or incendiary devices and especially that he had never heard of pencils containing glass tubes and that Hinsch had never shown him any explosive tubes or glass tubes. In that exhibit the following occurs on page 60 et seq. : " Q.. During the time you were together with Hinsch in New London, you were in close contact with him? A. Oh, yes. Q. Did you get the impression from what he was doing that he attended, also to other matters? A. No. O_. Did Captain Hinsch show you at any time during the years 1915, 1916, and ](J17, any explosive tubes, little glass tubes? A. No'. Q.. Did he show you at any time pencils that contained little glass lubes?</p>
<p>298</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMA.NY</h3>
<p>A. No. Q,. There is some testimony in the record that certain men had glass tubes con- taining sulphuric acid and other material which could be put into pencils. These glass tubes or pencils, it is claimed, were to be used in order to start fires. It is said that by cutting off the upper end of the pencil and cutting off the closed end of the tube, a rather strong flame would be produced; that after the sulphuric acid had run down and had ignited some material in this pencil, then there would be a flame about one foot or two feet long, and that these pencils were to be used in order to start fires: Did you ever hear anything about such devices? A. No. Q_. Did you ever see such devices A. (interposing) I didn't know Q_. (continuing) — in Captain Hinsch's possession? A. Not at all. Q_. Did he ever tell you about such devices? A. No. Q,. Have you any reason to believe that he had such devices? A. No, I have not. Q.. You stated that you met Friedrich Hermann in Baltimore while the Deutsch- land was there in July and the beginning of August, 1916? A. Yes. Q_. Did Hermann tell you at any time about these explosive tubes or pencils? A. No. Q,. Did you ever see in his possession any of such pencils or tubes ? A. No, not at all. Q_. Did he ever tell you that he had such devices? A. No, he didn't." (Emphasis supplied.) When an effort was made by the American Agent to examine Ahrendt under subpoena, under the Act of June 7, 1933 (48 Stat. 117), Ahrendt resisted the effort to compel him to give testimony; and there was employed for that purpose counsel who was also counsel for certain German ship owners holding awards of the War Claims Arbiter. Ahrendt finally submitted himself for examination (Ex. 975, Ann. C). During this examination Ahrendt repeated his previous denials of knowing anything about German sabotage activities in the United States during neutral- ity and especially the sabotage activities of Herrmann, Hilken and Hinsch. After he had made these specific denials the following questions and answers ensued : " Now, in the face of this record, do you still insist on your oath that you knew nothing of Hinsch's and Herrmann's admitted sabotage activities and that they were never discussed either by Hinsch or other parties with you or in your presence? A. I do. Q. In the face of this record, are you willing to submit your testimony to the Commission on your denial that you know anything about the activities of Herr- mann and Hinsch, and that they were not discussed or revealed to you at any time, and are you willing to ask the Commission to believe your denial in the face of this record? A. Yes." (Ex. 975, Ann. C, p. 260) The American Agent filed with his brief of September 13, 1938, an original letter written by Ahrendt to Paul Hilken dated January 19, 1917. This letter was located among the files of the Eastern Forwarding Company. The body of the letter seems to be confined entirely to business matters, apparently connected with the business of the Eastern Forwarding Company. Appended to the letter is a postscript entirely in the handwriting of Ahrendt which reads as follows:</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>299 " Yours of the 18th just received and am delighted to learn that the von Hin- denburg of Roland Park won another victory. Had a note from March who is still at McAlpin. Asks me to advise his brother that he is in urgent need of another set of glasses [sic]. He would like to see his brother as soon as possible on this account." It will be recalled that the Kingsland plant was destroyed by a fire that raged January 11th and 12th, 1917. In spite of the ingenious attempt on the part of the German Agent to break the force of the disclosure in the postscript quoted above, this postscript convicts Ahrendt of knowing that Herrmann (March) was in fact engaged in sabotage activities and that he desired another set of incendiary glasses or tubes. It also discloses the fact that Ahrendt was congratulating Hilken, the " von Hinden- burg of Roland Park " and the paymaster of the saboteurs in America, upon " another victory ". This record abounds in references to the incendiary tubes and to the fact that they are constantly called " glasses " (see Rec. p. 5586, Herrmann's Washington Examination, Rec. pp. 5443 et seq., pp. 5516 et seq., Rec. p. 5651 ; also Ger. Ex. CXXIII, pp. 14, 16; Ex. 764, Rec. p. 5649 et seq.). In the light of this record, the claims of Ahrendt, (1) that Hinsch had never shown him any explosive tubes or little glass tubes, (2) that he had never seen any such devices, (3) that Herrmann had never told him anything about explosive tubes or pencils and (4) that he knew nothing of the sabotage activities of Hinsch and Herrmann are clearly disproven by the postscript to his letter to Hilken written January 19, 1917. When we come to examine Hinsch's affidavit as to his absences from Baltimore and New London after the U-boat enterprise had been undertaken by him, Hinsch's claim that he never left the submarine bases just before and after the arrival and departure of the U-boat will be shown to be false, and Ahrendt's affidavit given for the purpose of corroborating Hinsch will also be proven to be false. It has been shown above that Ahrendt's testimony was false when he stated in his first affidavit that he never heard from anybody what Hinsch was doing in Mexico. Thus it clearly appears that Ahrendt's efforts to corroborate Hinsch have failed and that Ahrendt's affidavits cannot be used to destroy the confessions of Hilken and Herrmann. In Exhibit 986, Ann. A, p. 167 et seq., Herrmann while testifying under subpoena, under the Act of June 7, 1933 (48 Stat. 117), stated that upon his arrival in the United States from Berlin he met Paul Hilken and Captain Hinsch at the Hansa Haus in Baltimore in 1916; that Ahrendt was an employee of Hinsch or the North German Lloyd, working (in the Hansa Haus) as a member of the office force of Schumacher and Company. He states further that Ahrendt was Hinsch's "go-between" in sabotage work (p. 167); that when he (Herrmann) went to Washington to help Carl Dilger with the germ cultures and preparing the incendiary pencils (p. 168), he would usually bring them up to Baltimore and deliver them to Carl Ahrendt, if Hinsch or Hilken was not there. Ahrendt also at times went to Laurel, which was halfway between Baltimore and Washington, where Carl Dilger and Herrmann would meet him with a car and deliver the tubes and germs to him at the red railroad station in Laurel. At times when Herrmann delivered the germs and tubes to Hinsch, Ahrendt was used to distribute them to the different colored agents whom Hinsch had working for him, one of whom was Eddie Felton (id. p. 168). Herrmann met Ahrendt in New London, New York, Philadelphia, and in Nor- folk or Newport News, always in reference to the germ work and the incendiary tubes (id. pp. 169-171).</p>

<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>In the light of the fact that Ahrendt's affidavits drafted and introduced for the purpose of refuting Herrmann's testimony have been proven to be false, this testimony of Herrmann's with reference to his relations with Ahrendt has unusual significance. In the decision rendered at Hamburg on October 16, 1930, the opinion of the Commission has this to say about Hinsch (Decs, and Ops., p. 993): h " One is rather inclined to regard Hinsch's story that he gave up sabotage when he took over the Deutschland work as quite likely to be true. He may not have done this at once, but it seems more than likely that he would not while the Deutschland was at Baltimore have been active in sabotage. We do not regard the question whether Hinsch was absent from Baltimore during the two days before Black Tom as important in itself. He did not need to be absent, if they had been planning Black Tom for some time. Its importance relates only to Hinsch's credibility, and it does not have much importance from this point of view. It has some bearing on the credibility of other witnesses also. Our im- pression is that Hinsch was not absent from Baltimore at this time. " The fact that Hinsch let Herrmann stay around Baltimore, and that Herr- mann probably did some things or talked of some things in connection with sabotage at this time, and the talk about the pencils which Herrmann seems to have had with him at this time, tends against Hinsch's claim that he cut loose from sabotage. We would guess that Herrmann was not really doing much but talk and plan, and that Herrmann himself, particularly when the Deutschland was there, was doing nothing but work about her. And it is of course conceivable that we are wrong in disbelieving Marguerre's evidence that Herrmann was to take no action against munition plants or American property unless the United States entered the war. We do not believe that Hinsch would have mixed up sabotage so closely with the Deutschland, either by taking part in it himself or by letting Herrmann work on the Deutschland if Herrmann was then active in sabotage." In another part of the opinion, in comparing contradictory statements made by Hinsch with statements made by Hilken and Herrmann with refer- ence to Wozniak which were contradicted by Hinsch, the Commission said, page 971 :i " Hinsch, the man whom Herrmann connects with himself in the story, has denied it. His denial contains plausible details, but we could not rely on it if we felt that Herrmann was now telling the truth, for though we have no evidence that Hinsch is a liar, there is a strong presumption that he might be under circum- stances which pointed to his guilt." Thus the Commission seems to have credited Hinsch's story that he gave up sabotage when he took over the " Deutschland " work and was under the impression that Hinsch was not absent from Baltimore while the " Deutschland" work was going on. The Commission also seems to have been under the impression that Herrmann, during this time, was doing nothing but work upon the " Deutschland ", and the Commission expressed the opinion that Hinsch would not have mixed up sabotage so closely with the " Deutschland ", either by taking part in sabotage work himself or by letting Herrmann work on the " Deutschland " if Herrmann had been active in sabotage. It becomes necessary, therefore, to make a thorough study of the record in order to show clearly what was the relation of Hinsch to Herrmann and Hilken, and also, to ascertain whether Hinsch's affidavits, in which he denied engaging in sabotage after the U-boat enterprise started, were truthful. Hinsch made nine affidavits in behalf of Germany; and, as we have seen before, the object of his affidavits was. first, to strengthen the plea filed by b Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 100. ' Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 86.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>301 Germany that no sabotage was authorized in the United States during the neutrality of that country, and second, to show that, although men and material for sabotage were sent to the United States in 1916, the definite instruction was given that no active work of sabotage should be committed unless and until America entered the war. In order to establish these propositions, Hinsch's affidavits were drafted to deny a great many statements which were contained in the confessions of Hilken and Herrmann. Therefore, after a study of the record to determine what were the relations among Hinsch and Herrmann and Hilken, it will be necessary to make a minute examination in order to ascertain whether the affidavits of Hinsch, contradicting the confessions of Hilken and Herrmann, are worthy of belief. B. Fraud in the Evidence Hinsch's Relations with von Rintelen We have seen in another connection that Captain Hinsch brought the German steamer " Neckar " into Baltimore harbor and we shall develop thoroughly Hinsch's connections with Hilken, Herrmann and Woehst. Rintelen in his book, The Dark Invader (Ex. 990, Ann. E), after telling of the founding of the fictitious firm called " E. V. Gibbons Inc." (p. 94), then tells of his contacts with Dr. Scheele. the German chemist who came to him with a letter of recommendation from von Papen and brought with him one of his " cigars ", made out of a lead pipe with two compartments separated by a circular disc of copper, one compartment being filled with picric acid, and the other with sulphuric acid. The thickness of the disc determined how long it would take the two acids to eat their way through and cause an explosion (pp. 95-96). Rintelen met Karl von Kleist and received from him the suggestion that they make use of interned German sailors, and that they should get hold of Paul Hilken and Captain Hinsch of the Lloyd steamer " Neckar " (pp. 103-104). Likewise, through the suggestion of von Kleist, the headquarters were establish- ed on the German ship "' Friedrich der Grosse ", which was tied up in New York harbor (p. 106); and the activities on that ship are thus described by von Rintelen (p. 107): " During the following nights the great dark ship was the scene of ghostly activity. I had purchased large quantities of lead tubing through my firm, and my assistants carried it at night to the steamer, where it was cut up into suitable lengths. I had likewise obtained the necessary machinery through the firm, and after the lead had been cut up, and the copper discs prepared in various thicknesses, the little tubes were taken away again, under cover, in darkness, to Dr. Scheele's laboratory, where they were filled with acid. We had got to this stage when one morning one of my sailors appeared in the office, carrying a case of medium size under his arm. I was sitting at my desk, and he said to me: ' Excuse me, Captain, just move your legs a bit! ' I removed my legs, and he stowed the case in one the drawers of my desk. It was a disturbing neighbour to have! " The detonators were all fixed to go off in fifteen days, so they had to be disposed of as soon as possible. 1 took the man into the other room where Weiser was sitting and asked him to summon the captains, the sailors, and the Irish, whom I had meanwhile initiated into my scheme, for the same evening, so that we might start our dangerous work immediately. " ' All right,' said Weiser, ' I'll round them all up.' " On page 109 the following occurs: " One night, as I was leaning over the rail of the Friedrich der Grosse, gazing at the peaceful scene bathed in brilliant moonlight, all of a sudden the thought</p>
<p>302</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>struck me: Why not go to the root of things? Why not go after the piers them- selves, the piers at which the munition carriers were tied up? Gradually, this thought became a desire, the desire a resolution, and the resolution an instruction! " Von Rintelen then describes his trips to the various piers and shows how measurements were taken, distances paced out and possibilities were studied as to where motor launches could be comfortably fastened (p. 114). He then tells of a trip to the New Jersey piers and describes his visit to Black Tom as follows (p. 115): " One of our visits took us to ' Black Tom,' a rather curious name for a terminal station. It remains clearly in my recollection because of its quaint conformation, jutting out as it did like a monster's neck and head. I suppose that it was for this reason that it had derived the name of ' Black Tom.' To judge from the numerous railway tracks converging here, it appeared to be one of the chief points for the Allies' export of munitions. " I could not help urging upon myself the advisability of giving Black Tom a sound knock on the head — its mere name sounded so good to me : We could run little risk from paying Black Tom a compliment of this kind. Some peaceful summer evening — all arrangements properly made — a powerful speedboat at hand for us to disappear into the vastness of the Hudson River — it was all so remote from observation, from possible harm that might be done to human life! " About a year later, when I was a prisoner of war in Donington Hall, one hot summer morning my eyes fell upon a large headline in The Times:</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">EXPLOSION OF CHIEF PIER</h3>
<h3 class="doc-h3">OF ALLIED SHIPPING</h3>
<h3 class="doc-h3">' BLACK TOM ' BLOWN UP</h3>
<h3 class="doc-h3">BY ENEMY AGENTS</h3>
<p>" I had my own opinion as to how it had come about, and who were the men behind the scenes! " The relations between von Rintelen, Hilken and Scheele are clearly set out in a report of William R. Benham, Special Agent, made to the Department of Justice, dated September 13, 1916, made the 11th, l in connection with the case of U. S. v. Franz von Rintelen, et al., in which Rintelen was indicted with others for violation of antitrust laws, in placing bombs on ships engaged in foreign commerce (Ord. Ex. 140, Rec. p. 3794, et seq.). Benham made a report of a converstation that he had with Hilken in regard to his connection with Rintelen. In this report Hilken stated that sometime during the early part of May, 1915, he was in New York on business stopping at the Hotel Astor; that Rintelen called at the hotel and presented a letter of introduction from Captain W. Bartling, " an official of the North German Lloyd S. S. Co., Bremen, Germany. During this first meeting Rintelen spoke at length on the un-neutrality of America in the matter of financing the manu- facture of munitions. The next time Hilken met Rintelen was the latter part of May or early part of June, 1915, at Baltimore where Rintelen was Hilken's guest for two nights. Hilken took him to the Baltimore Country Club and to lunch at the Lawyers' Club in New York shortly after his visit in Baltimore. Again in June, 1915, Hilken came to New York where he met Rintelen and they went to the theatre together and he saw Rintelen again the same month in New York. The last 1 Hilken's 1916 Diary for September 11, 1916, has an entry reading " Benham from Washington interview." 1 For Hilken's correspondence with Bartling see Ex. 906 - A, D, E, and P.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>303 time he saw Rintelen was in Baltimore the latter part of June or early July. 1 In a statement dated November 17, 1915, of Mr. Henjez (Ord. Ex. 133, Rec. p. 3758), given in re: Hamburg-American Line cases, Henjez reported to Assistant United States Attorney, John C. Knox, that a man named Stein or Steinberg came to his office and wanted him to meet a man by the name of Hansen (Rintelen), who had been sent over by Captain Bartling of the North German Lloyd. (Hansen was an alias used by Rintelen.) Hansen came over to see him, said that he had been sent by Captain Bartling and that he wanted to have some men who were to blow up factories and, he believed, steamers. He said there were lots of ruffians and cut-throats in New York to be had. Henjez said: "I told Mr. Hansen I would have nothing to do with it." Henjez said that he visited Hansen twice in the building where the Trans- atlantic Trust Company was located and he was there in an office which had the name E. V. Gibbons &amp; Company and that Hansen introduced him to a tall, dark haired man by the name of Plockman (id. p. 3763). Henjez intro- duced Hansen (Rintelen) to Paul C. Helken (id. p. 3766). In the trial of von Rintelen and his associates, evidence was given that Dr. Scheele and his associates purchased lead pipe, that this lead pipe was taken to Dr. Scheele's office in his laboratory where there were different kinds of chemicals, that the factory was known as a fertilizer factory and it was shown that some of the lead pipe was delivered on the steamship "Friedrich der Grosse". The lead pipe was gotten from J. D. Johnson's on Cliff Street and taken to the " Friedrich der Grosse " in April, 1915 (Ord. Ex. 158 (1), pp. 3847, 3848). In the same case Frederick Henjez, Jr., the same man who had made the report to Assistant District Attorney Knox, testified, that early in 1915 before the sinking of the " Lusitania ," von Rintelen was introduced to him by a party named Stein or Steinberg (id. p. 3861), that von Rintelen asked him if he would put him, von Rintelen, in touch with anyone who could supply people to blow up bridges and factories and his answer was he could not do it (id. p. 3862), that von Rintelen stated that his purpose was to hamper the delivery of supplies to the Allied governments and that he was a representative of the German Government (id. p. 3863). In the same case George D. Barnitz, a member of the police force of the city of New York, testified as to a statement which the defendant, von Kleist, made with reference to the case. That statement is as follows (Ord. Ex. 158 (2), p. 3881): " And he dictated a statement which I wrote down in longhand and this state- ment covered a period of making bombs and placing them on board ships. The substance of it was that along about 1915, the beginning of 1915 " Mr. Wemple: Wait a minute. I object to this. It is all evident that is written, and I don't think it is proper for the witness to testify to the contents of a paper that is in writing. " The Court: Objection overruled. " Mr. Wemple: Exception. " The Witness. (Continuing) : And the defendant von Kleist said that along about, the early part of January, 1915, about that time, that a man by the name 1 Hilken's 1915 diary shows he was in contact with Rintelen (under the name of Hansen) and Hinsch in Baltimore during the period May 29-31, 1915; in New York with Rintelen (under the name of Gates) on June 23, 1915; and again in New York with Rintelen (under the name of Gates) and Hinsch on June 27, 1915 (Ex. 583, Ann.

<p>of Dr. Walter Scheele had come to him and said that he wished him to assist him in helping the Fatherland, and Scheele explained to him that what he wanted to do was to place bombs on board ships to the Allies, leaving this country for the purpose of preventing munitions and supplies reaching the allied governments- Von Kleist said that he was greatly affected himself over the fact that he, an old man, sixty-six years of age, could still be of some help to his dear old Fatherland, and they immediately went into partnership in making these bombs, and he said that Scheele said that he had received ten thousand dollars from von Rintelen, and this was to assist in making and manufacturing these bombs; that Scheele had a place in Garden Street, Hoboken, where the bombs were to be manufac- tured, and von Kleist said that Scheele asked him to get a good mechanic to assist him, and that he, von Kleist, mentioned the name of a plumber whose name I do not recall now, but who said he was a good man, but afterwards when Scheele met him, he said that he, Scheele, had the right man, and von Kleist said that he referred to Carl Schmidt and Becker on board the Frederick der Grosse, and it was here that the shells were to be used, where they were prepared, and it was here that the shells were to be used, where they were prepared, and after they were made they were taken to Scheele's laboratory, where they put chloride of potash on one side and sulphur on the other, and the object was that the partition between the two, the chloride of potash and the sulphur, would get on fire and it would melt the lead and it would set fire to whatever was near it. And those bombs, the defendant von Kleist stated, were placed in the holds of ships; and he said that part of it was left to Captain Wolpert and Bode. I asked him how many bombs were placed on various ships, and he said he was not positive, but, in his opinion, in the neighborhood of ten were used in the holds of each ship- That was the substance of the conversation that I had with the defendant von Kleist. I, later on, later on I went on the following day " Q.. Before you leave that, let me ask you : Is this the statement that you wrote at that time? " A. This is the statement as he dictated it, and as I wrote it in longhand. " Q_. Was that signed by him? A. That was signed, each page was signed by the defendant von Kleist. " Q_. And after that statement was written by you, was it read over lo him? " A. My recollection is that it was; and I questioned him on certain points." The defendant von Kleist was shown by Captain Tunney a bomb that came back from France and von Kleist looked at it and said, " Yes, this is one that did not go off. and this is what caused the fight between Wolpert, Dr. Scheele and Steinberg " (id. p. 3884). Hinsch's description of his sabotage activities is contained in German Exhibit CXXVII, at p. 109, where he says: " * * * I attempted at first to instigate strikes among the stevedores in ports, and furnished for that purpose negroes hired by me at the time with circulars which I caused to be distributed in Norfolk, Newport News and Baltimore. After that, we attempted to infect horses and mules transports with anthrax germs. I used the negroes also for that purpose. Finally, we manufactured so-called dumplings in order to cause fires on munitions ships and ships with contraband. I used Ed Felton and his negroes also for this purpose. " Q.- When did you start these activities? " A. In May, 1915, after I had talked with Rintelen personally." Paul Hilken in his deposition of December, 1928, first told about his contacts in 1915 with Rintelen and Hinsch (Ex. 583, pp. 2163-2171). The details of these contacts are given in his deposition of August 26, 1930 (Ex. 829, pp. 6094 et seg.), where he testifies as follows: He may have met Captain Hinsch when Hinsch was an officer of the North German Lloyd Steamship Company, but he certainly met him in the fall of 1914 when the " Neckar " arrived at Locust Point, Baltimore, of which steamer Hinsch was acting captain (id. pp. 6096, 6097). Rintelen, in the spring of 1915. called him from New York</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>305 and they met in Philadelphia and shortly thereafter Rintelen came to Baltimore and got in touch with Hinsch and Hinsch acted in the interest of Rintelen. Rintelen told him that he came to America " To investigate strikes among the stevedores at various ports. In fact, that was the first thing that he talked over with me. Also, to destroy ammunition aboard ships. * * • he told me he was placing these ' cigars ' aboard ships loaded with ammunition." (id. p. 6098.) At that time Rintelen did not mention the destruction of plants, but that came later (id. p. 6099). Hilken brought Hinsch and Rintelen together in Baltimore. Hilken received considerable money from Rintelen to pay Hinsch, probably in the neighborhood of $10,000 (id. p. 6101). The last payment which he made to Hinsch was when he (Hinsch) left for Mexico and it was in the neighborhood of $29,000 (id. p. 6101). All of these payments to Hinsch were for sabotage purposes, except the $29,000 which was to fit out a Commerce Raider in Mexico (id. p. 6101). The authority to pay money to Hinsch prior to Hilken's trip to Europe in 1916 came from Rintelen, but the authority after the trip to Europe came from Marguerre and Nadolny in " Sektion Politik " (id. p. 6101). Was Hinsch Telling the Truth in Claiming that He Ceased Sabotage Activities after the U-boat Enterprise Started? In German Exhibit CXXVIII, p. 107, Hinsch admitted that, when he first made Herrmann's acquaintance through Paul Hilken shortly after Paul Hilken returned from Germany in 1916, he got four or five empty small glass tubes from Herrmann, but he claimed never to have used them at all ; and he further denies that Carl Dilger, in the course of the year 1916, turned over to him a trunk with secret compartments in which small incendiary tubes were hidden '. In making this denial he confirmed a story told by Hilken that he sent Carl Dilger to Germany with a message in invisible ink, requesting the General Staff to keep Dilger over there. As we have seen in another place, Hinsch admitted instigating strikes among stevedores and injecting horses and mules transports with anthrax germs and manufacturing " dumplings " in order to cause fires on munitions ships and ships with contraband; and he further admitted that these activities began in May, 1915, after he had talked with Rintelen (Ger. Ex. CXXVIII, p. 109), but he claimed that after the return of Paul Hilken from Europe in April, 1916, he occupied himself exclusively with matters of submarine service and discon- tinued all other matters at the time of his first conference with Paul Hilken after his return from Germany. That Hinsch did not desist from sabotage activities after the arrival of the U-boat, is shown by his relations with Carl Dilger. Carl Dilger was the brother of Anton Dilger, who became the leader of sa- botage in North and South America with respect to infecting animals by injecting them with disease germs. They were of German parentage, and Anton Dilger, a graduate of Johns Hopkins, had served in the German Army as a surgeon until disabled, when he came to this country with a supply of cultures, anthrax and glanders germs (Ex. 771, Rec. p. 5781). Anton Dilger was also present at the famous meeting in Berlin, when Nadolny and Marguerre 1 It will be recalled that Marguerre admitted the manufacture of such a trunk and he would not deny that it was entrusted to Carl Dilger.

<p>gave their instructions to Hilken and Herrmann in regard to sabotage and sup- plied Herrmann with incendiary pencils. In German Exhibit CXXVIII, filed August 21, 1930, Hinsch classifies Carl Dilger as among those who had been employed by him for sabotage before he came in contact with U-boat service (p. 90). In denying that Carl Dilger had, in the course of the year 1916, turned over to him a trunk with secret compartments containing small incendiary tubes, Hinsch gives this description of his employment of Carl Dilger (p. 108): " I had used Carl Dilger in 1915 and also in 1916 in connection with our enter- prises against horses and mules transports. When I completely discontinued those matters in the beginning of 1916, Paul Hilken and I decided to send Dilger to Germany. He used to drink a great deal and wanted money continually. Paul Hilken wrote a report to the General Staff in invisible ink wherein the General Staff was requested to keep Carl Dilger by all means over there. Hilken then induced Dilger to leave for Germany and gave him that report to take along with him. Hilken told me later that Carl Dilger had returned from Germany and that he had a serious altercation with him. He told me also that he had learned from Dilger that he had thrown that report overboard. I, myself, never saw Carl Dilger again after his return. " Q,. Did the report which you mentioned and which Paul Hilken gave Carl Dilger contain any other communications? " A. No, as far as I know. I had agreed with Paul Hilken that he should write a report in invisible ink to the effect that Carl Dilger should be retained in Germany." It is important to examine the record to ascertain whether Hinsch was telling the truth when he stated in the above deposition that he and Hilken had decided to send Dilger to Germany, after he had completely discontinued sabotage in the beginning of 1916. The time of Carl Dilger's departure for Europe is definitely fixed as Friday, June 2, 1916, by the following quotation from Hilken's 1916 diary: " Lots of trouble with getting C. D. off lunch ' Astor ' — Lewis calls me on phone etc. C. P. H. K. xx " (Ex. 911, located December, 1931, and filed May 27, 1932). From the above entry in the diary it appears that Herrmann was in touch with Hilken on the same date that they succeeded, after lots of trouble, in " getting C.[arl] D.[ilger] off". Under date of June 1, 1916, Hilken wrote Captain W. Bartling, German Commercial Attaché at Copenhagen, with reference to Carl Dilger and his trip to Germany: " Herewith I send you * * * copy of a letter in the Danish language, which I am today giving to a man who is leaving here on Saturday [June 3, 1916] via steamer ' Kristianiafjord ', and who will look you up as soon as possible. You will be sure to make the arrangements necessary for the abovementioned gentleman to reach his destination as soon as possible and there find employment. He has become unnecessary to us. " Will you be so kind as to inform me, by postcard, if this letter reaches you, also whether Mr. D. has called on you and has traveled on." (Ex. 906, Ann. A; filed July 1, 1931.) (Emphasis supplied.) A second letter in relation to Carl Dilger's trip to Germany was written by Hilken on June 2, 1916, to one Haguested in Copenhagen (Ex. 906, Ann. O), and with this letter there was enclosed a letter in the Danish language addressed to Bartling and introducing Carl Dilger. The letter of introduction is as follows : " The bearer of these lines, Mr. C. Dilger, brother of the Mr. A. Dilger with whom you are acquainted, and who shared a room with me in Kônigshof, travels</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>307 in the belief that he had to deliver important letters for me to Germany. A few of them are important, without containing government secrets. " We are principally anxious that he may get in touch with his brother and, if possible, be kept busy for a long time. We have for the time being no suitable occupa- tion for him. / am convinced that you will make the necessary arrangements." (Ex. 906, Ann. P) (Emphasis supplied.) T o insure so far as possible the receipt by Bartling of the information relating to Carl Dilger, Hilken on J u n e 7, 1916, wrote Bartling in part as follows: " I confirm my letter of the 1st inst. in accordance with the enclosed copy, and I hope that Mr. C. D. has already visited you, prior to the arrival of this letter. In any event I would wish to write you (as today there is presented an especially good opportunity to transmit a letter to you) that the person mentioned has been made privy to certain secrets only through his brother, Dr. Dilger, against the judgment of Capt. H. and myself. To speak plainly, Capt. H. and 1 consider him to be a bluff, who would not accomplish much. Dr. D., on the contrary, was of the opinion that he can be very useful for good and entrusted him with different missions. After Dr. D. departed we limited as much as possible the activities of his brother. Lately, however, he has appeared to us to have become somewhat dangerous because of various statements, and we therefore decided, as already implied, to send him over there, in the expectation that he could be employed innocuously in Germany. This can best be done now, I believe, and without raising any suspicion, while he is being, first of all, put into communication with his brother. It goes without saying that we must, nevertheless, leave it to the gentlemen over there to do the needful." (Ex. 906, Ann. D) (Emphasis supplied.) In Exhibit 764, Rec. p. 5649, Carl Dilger, on April 18, 1930, tells how he came to Washington in 1915 and lived in Chevy Chase, D. C , until March or April, 1917. He and his brother, Anton, had a house at the corner of Living- ston and 33rd Streets. He states that his brother, during part of that time, maintained a laboratory in Chevy Chase for making disease cultures, and that he worked in this business with his brother for several months after he reached Washington (id. p. 5650). He was introduced by his brother to Hinsch, and Hinsch had charge of a lot of destruction work and work with cultures. In May, 1916, he was sent to Germany by Captain Hinsch and he thought that Paul Hilken helped to arrange for his going to Germany. He then testified as follows (Rec. p. 5650): " When I was sent to Germany in May 1916 I was given a package containing some papers which I was told to deliver over there. I never delivered the package that I had been given, because I thought the package contained reports of fires and other things that Hinsch and his men had been doing, and I was afraid that I would be caught with them on me, so I destroyed the papers." He went on to Germany and joined his brother, Anton, who had preceded him to Germany (id. p. 5651). He met Anton at Karlsruhe and they went together to Berlin and saw some German officials, among others, Giesler, Nadolny and Marguerre. These German officials " fixed up a trunk for me to take back to Captain Hinsch in Baltimore with some false sides in which they placed a number of incendiary tubes for use by Captain Hinsch in his work of destroying factories and munition supplies. Nothing was said to me in Berlin about not using them unless the United States got into the war. I never heard any such idea expressed anywhere either in Berlin or in the United States. It was my understanding that they were to be used right away and I gave them to Hinsch for that purpose. " I was in Germany altogether about six weeks or perhaps two months, and then I returned to the United States where I delivered the incendiary tubes to Captain Hinsch in Baltimore. / personally saw the incendiary tuba that were in the trunk and I knew that they were delivered in Baltimore." (id. p. 5651) (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p>308</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>He knew Fred Herrmann in the United States both before and after he went to Europe (id. p. 5652). He had a row with Hilken about some money that his brother, Anton, had given him, and which Hilken demanded and got from him,— about three or four thousand dollars (id. p. 5652). This was in the fall of 1916. He had several conversations with Hinsch and told him that he was going to quit and did quit before the United States entered the war (id. p. 5652). The exact date of Dilger's return to this country is not clear. His passport, however, indicates that he left Berlin on his return shortly after July 12, 1916. and that he was at the German Baltic port of Warnemiinde July 13, 1916 (Ex. 1001, Ann. A, (1) (2) ). In Hilken's 1916 diary the item for October 21. 1916, is as follows: " Washington Lewis, C. D. Ret to Balto. 3 p. m. meet Lewis at Union Station " (Ex.911). Therefore, is it clear that Hilken was with Carl Dilger and Herrmann in Washington on October 21st, 1916, and later met Herrmann at the Union Station at Baltimore. Herrmann's statement showing the relation of Carl Dilger to Hinsch, Hilken and himself was made on April 3, 1930 (Rec. pp. 5431. 5489). Carl Dilger's statement, showing Dilger's relations to Hilken, Hinsch and Herrmann and giving an account of his trip to Germany and his bringing the trunk with the false bottom or sides, was made on April 18, 1930 (Ex. 764. Rec. p. 5649). Hinsch's statement, which was designed to contradict Herrmann and Hilken, was made in Berlin August 4-8. 1930, and filed August 21, 1930 (Ger. Ex.</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">CXXVIII).</h3>
<p>When Herrmann made his confession (Rec. p. 5431. et seq.) there was nothing in the record relating to Carl Dilger's trip to Europe, which was forced upon him by Hinsch and Hilken, or his return to America bringing the trunk with the false bottom containing the incendiary tubes, and Herrmann's testimony on these points was the first reference relating thereto found in the record. When he was examined by the two agents April 3rd el seq., 1930, Herrmann first told about the fact that Woehst had come from the General Staff, with instructions to report to Hilken, but he was not sure at that time that Woehst had brought any tubes along. He was sure, however, that they got more tubes. " through another fellow who brought over several hundred in a trunk. They were hidden away in the slats. They bored the slats out and filled them in." (Rec. p. 5489.) At this point the transcript shows as follows (Rec. p. 5489) : " Q.- Who was the other fellow? A. Anton Dilger's brother, Carl Dilger. He brought those tubes that time. Carl Dilger was working with Anton on this horse affair, these germs, and he and Captain Hin^sch had a scrap, and Hintach says ' We have to get rid of this fellow ', and they fixed up a letter for him to report to Marguerre or Nadolny, and they were to keep him over there until after the war. They were afraid he might say something over here. He got the letter from Paul Hilken and he went to Germany, and in about six weeks he came back again. We were surprised to see him and asked him what the hell the idea was, and he said he brought over a lot more of these tubes and different things. We asked him 'How about the letter? Didn't you deliver the letter? ' He said 'No, I got a scare at Kirkwall and threw it overboard.'</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>309 " Q. Do you know of anybody else who brought tubes over from Germany? A. I brought some over. I am not sure if Woehst brought some over or not. " Q.- When did Carl Dilger come back with those tubes? A. I don't. Meantime, I think we liquidated the house. We lived out here near the Chevy Chase country club, with Dilger's sister, and Dilger and myself. " Q. You said he brought those tubes in a trunk? A. Yes. " Q.- Will you repeat that? A. He brought those tubes in a trunk. The trunk was fixed up. There were slats in the walls, and he separated the panels and bored holes to fit these tubes in, and glued the trunk together again. " Q.. What became of Carl Dilger? A. I don't know what became of him. " Q.- Was he living in Washington? A. He was living together with me, here, out here in Chevy Chase." (Rec. pp. 5489-5491.) It was after the above testimony was given on April 3, 1930, that Carl Dilger was located and his affidavit of April 18, 1930 (Ex. 764), found in the record at page 5649, was secured. Thus Herrmann's statements with reference to Carl Dilger were corroborated by Hinsch in German Exhibit CXXVIII, p. 108, in the following particulars: First, that Hinsch had used Carl Dilger in 1915 and 1916 in his enterprises against horse and mule transports ; second, that Hilken and Hinsch had decided to send Dilger to Germany; third, that Hilken had given him a secret message to the General Staff with the request that Dilger be kept over there by all means; fourth, that Dilger had an altercation with Hilken and; fifth, that Dilger had thrown the secret message overboard. (Supra, this opinion, p. 95.) ' Herrmann is further confirmed by Dilger not only on all these points but upon the fact that Dilger returned with the trunk with false sides or bottom containing incendiary tubes and that these tubes were delivered to Hinsch. In this connection it will be recalled that Marguerre admitted that " Sektion Politik " had manufactured incendiary pencils which contained little glass tubes; that the construction of these tubes and the method of using them were explained to Herrmann; and the incendiary pencils were turned over to Herr- mann packed in cartons, thirty to a carton (Ger. Ex. CXXIII, examination of July 30, 1931, pp. 15-19). Marguerre also recalled that sometime after Herrmann's visit " we had a trunk made with a double bottom in order to pack glass tubes therein in a secret partition ". He stated that he did not know who was entrusted with this trunk and he also stated " whether this trunk was handed over to one Carl Dilger I do no longer remember "; but " I cannot say that it was not done " (Ger. Ex. CXXVIII, examination of August 1, 1930, pp. 1-3). The reasons given by Hinsch and Hilken for sending Carl Dilger abroad, apparently against his will, are: (1) according to Hinsch, " he used to drink a great deal and wanted money continually " (Ger. Ex. CXXVIII, p. 108); (2) according to Hilken " he has become unnecessary to us " (Ex. 906, Ann. A) ; (3) " We have for the time being no suitable occupation for him" (Ex. 906, Ann. P) ; (4) he " has been made privy to certain secrets only through his brother, Dr. Dilger, against the judgment of Capt. H. and myself" (Ex. 906, Ann. D); (5) " Capt. H. and I consider him to be a bluff, who would not accomplish much" (Ex. 906, Ann. D); (6) " He had appeared to us to have become somewhat dangerous because of various statements " (Ex. 906, Ann. D). i Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 306. 21</p>

<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>The purposes of Hinsch and Hilken in sending him abroad are stated as follows : (1) that he be kept busy for a long time (Ex. 906, Ann. D) ; (2) that he " could be employed innocuously in Germany "' (Ex. 906. Ann. D) ; (3) " it goes without saying that we must, nevertheless, leave it to the gentlemen over there to do the needful " (Ex. 906, Ann. D). This correspondence, together with the confession of Dilger himself, corro- borate minutely the prior statement of Herrmann and show the falsity of the claim made by Hinsch, that after the return of Paul Hilken from Germany in March, 1916, he occupied himself exclusively with matters of the submarine service and had discontinued all other matters such as instigating strikes, infecting horse and mule transports and incendiary sabotage against munitions (Ger. Ex. CXXVIII, pp. 109, 110). In the same Exhibit (Ger. Ex. CXXVIII), Hinsch had already described (p. 16) the conversation which he had with Hilken in regard to U-boats coming to America and Hilken's plan to put Hinsch in charge of the loading and unloading of the U-boats. Hinsch became enthusiastic about the service and he told Hilken (p. 17): " that I would undertake it only if all other matters which had been undertaken by us prior thereto would be stopped completely." And he told Hilken distinctly: " Paul, under all circumstances, we must drop everything else, for this matter is so important that we must not blur it, * • * " (p. 17). Hilken's reply was (p. 18) : " During these days somebody is coming from the General Staff— an alert young fellow who, during the war, was three times in England. He also brings new things along. We cannot help seeing him first. / am to support him with money." (Emphasis supplied.) This alert young fellow was Herrmann, who was to be supported by Hilken with money, and he did continue the same kind of sabotage work that Hinsch had been engaged in. The pretense of Hinsch that he and Hilken were to have nothing more to do with sabotage work was an effort to support the false pleadings filed by Germany to the effect that she never authorized sabotage in America while the United States was neutral. Hinsch, by relating this conver- sation with Hilken, betrays the fact that he was aware that Herrmann, under Hilken as paymaster, would continue, with "new things", the same sabotage activities which he, Hinsch, had been engaged in since May, 1915, after he had talked with Rintelen personally (Ger. Ex. CXXVIII, p. 109). The claim of Hinsch that he discontinued sabotage activities after the return of Paul Hilken from Europe in 1916 is further disproven by the affidavit of J. Edward Felton (Ex. 761, Rec. p. 5631). Felton had been engaged in stevedore work for the North German Lloyd from 190R up to the time of the war. He met Captain Hinsch when the latter brought the steamer " Neckar ", the North German Lloyd ship, into Baltimore. He was employed by Hinsch to distribute circulars among the stevedores at Norfolk, urging them to go out on strike (id. p. 5632). He was next employed by Hinsch to set fire to supplies that were designed for Europe, consisting of grain, cotton, horses, and other supplies. This was early in 1915. For the purpose of causing these fires, Hinsch furnished him with " some things ", about the si/.e of a small egg, and showed Felton how to fill them with acid and</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>3 1 1 instructed him how to cause a flame and start the fires. Felton gave them to his men to put around among the wheat and cotton and other supplies on the docks and in warehouses and on the ships, and this was according to instructions of Captain Hinsch. The first work " with these fire things " for Hinsch commenced some time early in 1915 and regularly for a year or two he was receiving and using " these things " for starting fires (id. p. 5633). These fire things started different fires that occurred later. He says we credited our men with the follow- ing fires — No. 9 Pier in Baltimore, elevators at Canton, one fire in Norfolk and several fires in ship cargoes (id. p. 5634). A few months after he was employed to start fires, Hinsch started him working with disease germs among the horses that were being collected for shipment at Norfolk, Newport News and New York City. This was the late summer or early fall of 1915 and continued for the period of nearly a year (id. p. 5634). The fire which destroyed the Canton elevators occurred on the 13th day of June, 1916 (Ex. 842, Rec. p. 6253), more than two months after Hilken came back from Germany in March, 1916. The Eastern Forwarding Company was chartered in May, 1916 (Ex. 976, Ann. A-D, pp. 18, 227), and its officers were engaged from that time forward in preparing for the first trip of the " U-Deutsch- land ". Among the letters filed with the brief of the American Agent of September 13, 1938, was the original carbon copy of a letter dated June 14, 1916, addressed to Hilken, taken from the files of the Eastern Forwarding Company, in the course of which the following occurs : " Unfortunately I must bring you bad news, the Canton elevator burned up here. Two steamers (1 Engl. and 1 Holl) were also lost. The Englishman had muni- tions on board and I'm not sorry for him. But the elevator will do much damage to Baltimore and it is to be regretted because several lives were lost." In the brief filed September 13, 1938, this letter was attributed to Hinsch (p. 36) ; and in the oral argument of January 16, 1939, Mr. Mitchell also again attributed to Hinsch the letter (Trans, of Argument, p. 73) and no denial has been made by the German Agent of this fact. Whether Hinsch wrote the letter or noi. whoever did write it registered his sorrow at the loss of the elevator in a method which would cause one to doubt his sincerity, and this incident would seem to prove that Felton was correct in ascribing the fire to one of his men and that Hinsch was not telling the truth when he claimed that he had ceased all sabotage after Hilken's return from Europe in March, 1916. Felton's affidavit is confirmed by George Turner (Ex. 772. Rec. p. 5784). Turner was hired by Felton to start fires among the cargoes of ships and was given devices for starting these fires. He distributed these devices at Baltimore, Norfolk and Newport News. He also inoculated horses which had arrived at a port awaiting shipment to the allies. For this work he was paid by Felton, who told him he had received the money from Hinsch. Felton was further confirmed by the affidavit of John Grant (Ex. 773, Rec. p. 5791), who made oath that he worked for Felton in Newport News and Norfolk in 1915 in ' 'starting fires and s ticking needles into horses to make the horses sick ". He began this work in the latter part of 1914 or the early part of 1915 and continued it for over a year. He did a good bit of the work himself and occasionally found two or three men whom he could trust and got them to help him; and this was in accordance with what Felton told him that he and Captain Hinsch wanted done. The affidavit of Felton is further confirmed by the affidavit of Arthur Young (Ex. 774, Rec. p. 5793). who in addition to the same kind of work that was done by the other employees ofFelton. was sent toHopewell to get a job in theDuPont</p>
<p>312</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>factory in order to try to start a fire there (id. p. 5795). After getting to Hope- well, however, he was not willing to try it because the guards were very strict in searching the men and there were many rules against carrying anything into the factory and he was afraid of getting caught. The fire that took place in the Hopewell factory was some time after he left (id. p. 5796). Further and conclusive evidence that the Hilken-Hinsch-Herrmann group of saboteurs did not discontinue their sabotage activities following the establish- ment of the commercial submarine service is found in the contemporaneous correspondence of the various saboteurs. Hilken on August 7, 1916, cabled Arnold, the German saboteur then in Ha- vana en route to the Argentine, as follows: " Have been trying arrange meeting with you Regret impossible leaving be- fore September if you consider advisable will send trustworthy representative to meet you Panama 21st Cable your decision " (Ex. 906, Ann. Y). That the " trustworthy representative " here referred to was Herrmann and that Hinsch was aware of the activities of both Herrmann and Arnold is established by Hilken's letter of August 7, 1916 (through error letter dated 1917 (Ex. 976, Anns. A-D. p. 87)), to his father in which he says, reading in translation : " Hinsch and I had already thought over in reference to Cuba that it is at present impossible for me to get away, and that we must therefore send Lewis [Herrmann] there." (Ex. 42 attached to Ex. 976, Anns. A-D) Hilken in his letter of August 21, 1916, to Arnold describes the " trustworthy representative " as being " a young man who has been in the employ of our friends abroad " (Ex. 906, Ann. BB-1). In a subsequent letter of January 11, 1917, Hilken wrote Arnold expressing satisfaction that his superiors in Germany had recently sent Woehst over to this country manifestly to assist in sabotage work. In his letter, Hilken approves a proposed visit to this country of Arnold and describes the purpose of such a visit as: " * * * a good one, especially as our principals abroad, realizing that my other interests require too much of my time and make it impossible for me to devote my energies to their interests, have sent a young man, who arrived here a month ago and whom I have since initiated into our American trade. He brought with him several new samples which may also find a market in Argentine." (Ex. 906. Ann. HH) Hilken in his examination under subpoena in September, 1933, testified as follows in relation to the cryptic references in this letter : " First of all, who are the ' principals abroad ' to whom you refer? " A. Nadolny and Marguerre. " CL Who is the young man you mentioned? " A. What date is that letter? "Q.. January 11, 1917. " A. That is Willie Woehst. " Q.- What is the subtle allusion to your initiating him ' into our American trade '? " A. That is undoubtedly sabotage. It can refer to nothing else. " Q.- What are the ' new samples ' which he is supposed to have brought with him? " A. Probably pencils, incendiary devices of some sort — I don't remember; no doubt that is what I was referring to. " Q_. You say, ' These samples may also find a market in Argentine.' " A. Yes, Arnold was carrying on sabotage in the Argentine.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>3 13 " Q. Am I correct, then, in the inference that Woehst was sent here to speed up the sabotage activities in the latter part of 1916? " A. As I have stated right there in that letter, I was busy, Hinsch was busy to a certain extent and was taking care of Fred Herrmann, too. I was only one man. How much could one man do? They naturally wanted me to have some more men. Probably if the War continued, or if the United States had not gotten into the War, I might have had other men sent over here, too. Naturally, with all the munition plants which were at that time manufacturing munitions — powder, guns, and everything — for the Allies, Hinsch and Herrmann could only take care of a very small part, and it was natural for them to send another man over here to help out. Of course, Hinsch and Herrmann had their underlings, but we felt the need for an additional key-man to do directing, as Herrmann and Hinsch were doing directing." (Ex. 976, Ann. E, pp. 50-52.) In the same deposition, Hilken testified as follows in relation to Hinsch's testimony that he discontinued sabotage activities shortly after Hilken's return from Berlin in the latter part of March, 1916: " There was never any thought of Hinsch or Herrmann, and their men, quitting sabotage activities. In fact, Herrmann had brought with him the new incendiary devices, the tubes, and it was from that time onward that sabotage could be practised with greater effect. After my return from Germany, instead of quitting, the work was carried on with greater intensity. " I remember distinctly the meeting that we had up in the attic of the Hansa Haus, all three of us together, Hinsch, Herrmann and myself. Although we all realized and agreed that we must be discreet in our activities, so as not to jeopardize the submarine work, we had no idea of suspending sabotage." (Ex. 976, Ann. E, pp. 53, 54.) The Absence of Hinsch and Herrmann From Baltimore Before and After the Destruction of Black Tom One of the purposes for which German Exhibit LXXXIV, the affidavit of Hinsch, was filed was to substantiate Hinsch's claim that neither he nor Herrmann could have participated in the destruction of Black Tom, which occurred early on the morning of Sunday, July 30, 1916. In this affidavit, Hinsch alleges that he was entrusted with making preparations for the arrival, unloading and load- ing of the " Deutschland " in Baltimore; that she arrived " in the middle of July " and started on her return voyage on August 2, 1916. that is, three days after the explosion of Black Tom. He then alleges as follows: " At this period I stayed permanently in Baltimore. My energy, attention and care were up to the last degree devoted to the idea to let the submarine for which six war vessels were waiting outside the territorial waters safely reach the open sea." (Emphasis supplied.) (p. 6.) In German Exhibit CXXXIII, Hinsch states that, from the end of April or beginning of May, 1916, until the sailing of the " U-Deutschland " from Balti- more, he was away from Baltimore only twice, the first time when he went to Norfolk and Newport News with Paul Hilken in order to ascertain whether they could find a suitable place there for the submarines, the second time, some- time during the last week of June, when he went out on the tug " Timmins " for the purpose of waiting for the " U-Deutschland " there. We have already shown that Ahrendt (in Ger. Ex. CII, pp. 37-41) claimed to be very intimate with Hinsch and that it was impossible for Hinsch to have any activities outside of caring for the " Neckar " and his U-boat enterprise. A careful examination of the record contradicts both Hinsch and Ahrendt in these claims.</p>

<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>On Saturday. July 22nd. Hinsch was in New York, a;, is shown by a letter from Dederer. Treasurer, dated July 22nd. addressed to Captain Hinsch in New York (Ex. 976, Anns. A-D, pp. 235-238, " Dederer, Ex. 55 "). For the week beginning the 25th of July and ending the 1st of August. Hinsch was away from Baltimore for two days during the latter part of that week. In Exhibit 811. Rec. p. 6019, 6023, Fesmire testified as follows: " The Deutschland was scheduled to leave Baltimore on July 26th or 27, 1916. For some reason which was never explained to me, the departure was deferred and the boat did not leave Baltimore until August 1st, 1916. Hinsch was away from Baltimore for two days during the latter part of the preceding week about three or four days before the Deutschland sailed. His absence must have com- menced, as near as I can fix it, about the 28th or 29th of July. He was away over at least one night, and I think for two nights. I do not know where he was. He did not tell me and I never ascertained. I remember the circumstances very distinctly, however, because I know that we were looking for Captain Hinsch to ask him about some matters and no one seemed to know where he was. He was missing from Baltimore for about two days." And again on p. 6028 Fesmire said: " Hinsch did not confide in me regarding the various activities) which occupied his time during the spring, summer and fall of 1916, except the work with which I had strictly to do, namely, in connection with the two arrivals of the Deutschland. I should estimate that this work of the Deutschland did not take more than about one-third of Hinsch's time during my acquaintance with him. which commenced around the end of March or the first of April 1916. I knew that Hinsch was engaged in other activities. I associated him in my mind with the destruction of one of the grain elevators in Baltimore and the fire on Pier 9 in Baltimore." On Thursday, August 3rd, Hinsch was at Norfolk and left the tug boat " Timmins " for Hoboken (Ex. 811, Rec. p. 6025, original telegram at Norfolk dated August 3, 1916, sent by Hinsch to Eastern Forwarding Company filed with brief of September 13, 1938). On Friday, August 4th, Hinsch attended a party on the roof of the Hotel Astor given by Hilken in celebration of the Black Tom explosion. (Hilken's diary for 1916, Ex. 911, Ann. A; Ex. 976, Ann. E, p. 58; Ex.986, Ann. A, p. 76). On Saturday, August the 5th, the North German Lloyd Steamship Co. granted Captain Hinsch a leave of absence while he was present at Hoboken. New Jersey (Ger. Ann. 161. Ex. A (1)). On Sunday, August 6th, Hilken. Hinsch and Herrmann (Lewis) were regis- tered at the Mohican Hotel in New London, and on the following day, Tuesday. Hinsch was again registered at the same hotel (Ex. 831, Anns. 1 and 2). On Tuesday, the 8th of August, he was in New York at the Hotel Astor and remained until Wednesday, when he went to Baltimore (Ex. 911. Ann. A: Ex. 976, Ann. E, pp. 61, 73; Ex. 976, Ann. A; Ex.41). Thus it is seen that both before and after the departure of the " Deutschland " Hinsch was frequently away from Baltimore and the U-boat enterprise did not take up all of his time; and Hinsch's affidavits on this subject have been proven to be false. Absence of Hinsch from New London Before and After the Kingsland Fire As in the case of the Black Tom explosion Hinsch claimed to have been so thoroughly taken up with U-boat activities that he could not leave Baltimore, so, also in the case of the Kingsland fire, which occurred on the 11th day of January, 1917, Hinsch again claims that he was so closely confined to the U-boat base at New London that it was impossible for him to have participated in any</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>315 sabotage activities (Ger. Ex. CXXVIII, pp. 79-82; Ger. Ex. CXXXIII, pp. 16, 17). It was also claimed for him by Ahrendt that he (Hinsch) was in New London so regularly that it was impossible for him to have been in Kingsland or concerned with any of the sabotage work at Kingsland (Ger. Ex. CII, pp. 55-60). These claims neglect the fact that New London and New York were only a few hours apart, and one could have been present carrying on his business activities in both cities on the same day. An examination will be made of the record, however, to ascertain whether Hinsch's and Ahrendt's affidavits are true when they claim that Hinsch was constantly in New London both before and after the Kingsland fire. On Wednesday, January 3, 1917, Hinsch arrived in Baltimore. Hilken's diary for January 3, 1917, has the following entry: " Wednesday 3 X Lv. N. H. noon arrive N. L. 4. p m. Capt. H. lvs. for Balto. Lyceum [illegible] " (Ex. 583, Ann. D, Rec. p. 2326). Under date of December 30, 1916, Hinsch wrote a letter from New London, Connecticut, to H. G. Hilken in which he stated as follows: " I shall arrive in Baltimore on Wednesday evening, January 3id. so we will be able to talk this matter over during my stay there." (Ger. Ann. 156, Ex. T.) On Friday, January 5th, 1917, and probably on the preceding day Hinsch was away from New London; for on January 5th Paul G. L. Hilken wrote a letter to A. LSchumacher and Company from New London in which he stated as follows: " The writer will remain at New London until the return of Capt. Hinsch next Monday [January 8th] * * * ". (See letter from the Eastern Forwarding Company files, filed with brief of September 13, 1938.) On Saturday, January 6, 1917, Hinsch was away from New London as was indicated by the last letter quoted above. See also, however, letter of Hoppenberg dated February 3rd to the Eastern Forwarding Company where he sends a voucher dated New York, Jan. 6, 1917, to " expenses entertaining Mr. Bôhme &amp; Capt. Hinsch— SI 1.30". (Eastern Forwarding Company's files, filed with brief of September 13, 1938.) On Sunday, January 7th, Hinsch was away from New London as was indic- ated by the item for Friday, January 5th, supia. On Monday, January 8th, Hinsch was in New London. See letter of Hilken to his father of January 7. 1917, from the Eastern Forwarding Company files ; also telegram, New London. January 8. 1917, Hinsch to Hilken, Sr., German Annex 156-U; also letter of Hinsch to Henry G. Hilken dated January 8,1917, German Annex 156-V. The record is silent as to Hinsch's whereabouts on January 9th, 10th and 1 lth, but on Friday, January 12th, he was in New London (see Ger. Ann. 163. L, telegram of Hinsch to Hilken, Sr., dated at New London). The claim of Hinsch and Ahrendt that Hinsch was not away from New London preceding the fire at Kingsland is contradicted by Carl Metzler in Ger. Ex. XCVIII. Metzler was paymaster at the North German Lloyd Steamship Company and had been in their employ since May 1, 1898. When asked whether Hinsch was away from New London at any time, he said (p. 28) : " A. Capt. Hinsch was away from New London as far as I can remember now, either in the middle of December or the end of December — I cannot remember</p>
<p>316</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>distinctly — but I remember that Capt. Hinsch told me, ' Metzler, I am going away for a few days to Baltimore in my car. Take good care of our work.' That is all he said. " Q.. And he left New London by car — by automobile? " A. I did not see him myself, sir, but he told me that he would make the trip to Baltimore and back to New London with his own machine. * * * it was winter and very cold — plenty of snow in New London." He stated that Hinsch was not away from New London more than three or four days. And again at page 79 he said that his office was in the same building with Hinsch and " I saw him every day with the exception of a few days in December, but I coula not remember what date in December. If my memory does not fail me, it was either in the middle of December or at the end of December. Then Capt. Hinsch told me that he would be absent for a few days because he wanted to go to Baltimore in his machine. Whether he did so or not I do not know. I just state what Capt. Hinsch told me." Jeremiah Dillon, a Deputy Collector of the United States at New London, who had been in the service for many years, was at New London in the years 1916 and 1917 in his capacity as Deputy Collector. He knew Hinsch, who had a house in Neptune Park, from the latter part of August, 1916, until nearly the time when war was declared on April 6, 1917, and he testified that Captain Hinsch " was in New London off and on during that time ", and that Captain Hinsch was " away from New London for two or three weeks during the early part of January, 1917 and/or the latter part of December, 1916". He was able to fix the date on account of the death of his brother-in-law on the 20th of January, 1917 (Ex. 813, Rec. p. 6034). Hinsch — His Sabotage Activities in Mexico after the United States Entered the War We have already seen in another connection that before the United States entered the war Herrmann went to Mexico and got in touch with the Minister to Mexico, von Eckardt, and that on April the 12th, 1917, six days after America entered the war, von Eckardt forwarded to Berlin a message from Herrmann making inquiry as to the whereabouts of Woehst and as to $25,000 which had been promised him. The Minister doubted his authority and represented that Herr- mann claimed to have a commission to fire the Tampico Oil Fields. " Sektion Politik " confirmed Herrmann's claim and stated that the destruction of the Tampico Oil Fields would be of great military advantage but left the decision to von Eckardt as to whether this should be done (supra, pp. 34, 35, this opinion) .k These telegrams confirmed Herrmann's confession that his sabotage activities in the United States did not await the entry of the United States into war, but that the sole purpose for which he was employed and sent to the United States was to carry on sabotage in the United States irrespective of her entry into the war. That Herrmann continued his sabotage activities in neutral Mexico is tho- roughly established by two contemporaneous reports made to the State Department. On August 1, 1917, four months after the United States entered the war, and therefore years before any claims for sabotage were ever formulated or presented, S. LeRoy Layton, American Vice Consul then in Canada, made a report to the Secretary of State, of a " plot to blow up the oil wells at Tampico ". In that report he related a story told him by Gerdts, at Barranquilla, Columbia, prior to Layton's departure from his post as Vice Consul in Colombia to his new post k Note by the Secretariat, this volume, pp. 262-263.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>317 in Canada. From that story, it appears that, when Herrmann fled from the United States to Mexico, he took with him the incendiary tubes which he had been using against munition factories in America. He showed them to Gerdts, and offered Gerdts a weekly salary and a large bonus if Gerdts would accompany him to Tampico and assist in blowing up the oil wells (Ex. 583, Ann. G, Rec. pp. 2345-2348). This story is confirmed by a report to the Secretary of State made on August 24, 1917, by Claude E. Guyant, American Consul at Barranquilla, and who gave a careful account of his interview with Gerdts. (Ex. 583, Ann. H, Rec. pp. 2350-2354.) Both reports are confirmed on this point by the affidavit of Gerdts (Ex. 626 (a), Rec. pp. 2765, 2774.) In May, 1917, Hinsch went to Mexico (Ger. Ann. 71, p. 2) and the record shows clearly that he continued in Mexico the same kind of sabotage activities which he had been carrying on in the United States. An examination of the intercepted messages passing between Mexico and Berlin, usually through Madrid, and between Buenos Aires and Berlin, usually through Madrid (Ex. 320, Rec. pp. 880 et seq.), will show that not only Herr- mann but Hinsch and Jahnke and Arnold were continuously engaged in sabotage matters after the entry of the United States in the war. Quotations will be made from some of these intercepted telegrams, but no attempt will be made to quote from, or to digest, all in this series. On December 8, 1917, the Military Attaché (in Mexico) sent a telegram in which he stated as follows: " In the interval I have started sabotage in the States with the assistance of * * * HINSGH who is representing me for the time being. * * * " (Ex. 320, Rec. p. 881). On December 27, 1917, a message was forwarded to Berlin from which the following is taken (Rec. p. 883) : " From a conversation DELMAR [A. Dilger] has received the impression that not alone JAHNKE is not self-reliant but that he is not entirely reliable. There- fore and because I have up to the present received no reply to Telegram 365 I have handed the contents of No. 196 to the messenger for Captain HINSCH especially as he is a German and also because he enjoys the confidence of the Minister. * * * " On January 4, 1918, in a message from Berlin to Madrid for Delmar, the following occurs (Rec. p. 884) : " The Admiralty has withdrawn the commission to JAHNKE for sabotage under- takings, and contemplates appointing HINSCH instead. As the latter is already in service with you, the Admiralty agree that HINSCH shall remain under your orders and shall be occupied in naval business in January. * * * " The next telegram in the series contains a message from Berlin to Madrid from which the following sentence is taken: "Agree to the employment of Hinsch." (Rec. p. 885.) Another intercepted telegram bearing on the same subject is found in Exhibit 320, Rec. p. 903, reading as follows: " From : Madrid To Berlin 28.3.18 No. 178 of March 26th. " Our Minister in MEXICO has sent the following telegram for the Foreign Office to the Military Attache under No. 1073, to be passed on the General Staff Political : —</p>

<p>" 'Co-operation between PJAHNKE and HINSCH is, in consequence of their mutual distrust impossible. " ?JAHNKE'S work must not be interrupted and he is therefore receiving financial support through me. " In consequence of very grave discoveries I request permission to (dismiss) DELMAR, HINSCH and — from my (Intelligence) Service, (approval to be in- dicated by telegraphing the word ' (dismiss) ' von ECHARDT 21st February, 1918.' " Exhibit 320, Rec. pp. 905-912, contains messages from Madrid to Berlin and from Berlin to Madrid bearing on the contest between Jahnke and Hinsch, and refers to their " S. service " and " S. undertakings " and contains a message from Jahnke to the Chief of the Admiralty Staff at Antwerp (No. 368) objecting to his being placed under Hinsch's orders. No. 369 of that series reads as follows (p. 907) : " DELMAR [A. Dilger] similarly fears that JAHNKE will none the less des- patch a letter finding fault with HINSCH and DELMAR. Finally he asks defin- itely to be allowed to work independently, as he expects great independence, and has himself collected the sum of 100,000 pesos for the Legation in Mexico. JAHNKE further reports — The destruction of war factories and provisions in the U.S.A. is working satisfactorily. Since May, 1917 my people report as destroyed, the English S.S. CLARK, Japanese S. S. ITFH (?SHINNO) " (Emphasis supplied). On p. 912 is the following: " From: — Berlin To:— Madrid</p>
<p>D-3 " No. 25122 of April 16th [1918] "With reference to Telegram 1172 of April 1st " ARNOLD'S return to Germany is not advisable because of the risk of seizure. Communication with Ireland and America is important. Arnold is to try to win over people for the U.S.A., if possible organizers, on the one hand for sabotage and on the other hand for increasing the inclination for peace. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">GENERAL STAFF."</h3>
<p>Exhibit 320, Rec. p. 913, contains a copy of a message from the Admiralty Staff in Berlin to the Naval Attaché at Madrid which reads in part as follows: " undertakings against the PANAA1A Canal are highly desirable." (Emphasis supplied.) The rest of the message authorizes monthly expenses not to exceed 100,000 marks and certain rewards for undertakings proved to be successful: For warships and trading ships one-fifth per cent of the value of the ship and cargo; for all other objectives, a lump sum not exceeding 50,000 mks and varying according to the importance and extent of the damage * * * " The reward is to be paid at the discretion and after the investigation of the Minister." An examination of the above telegrams discloses the fact that, in Mexico. Delmar (Anton Dilger) and Hinsch, had come from the United States, just as Herrmann had done, and they probably found antagonism among saboteurs al- ready present in Mexico. Therefore, they incurred the doubt and enmity of von Eckardt, who wished to dismiss them from his service. These saboteurs, however, did not cease their activity after America entered the war, but simply transferred their base to Mexico, and were authorized by the Admiralty Staff to spend not exceeding 100,000 marks per month; and they were to receive as reward for their undertaking, if their undertaking should prove successful, one- fifth per cent of the value of the ship and cargo, and for other objectives a lump sum not exceeding 50.000 marks, varying according to the importance and extent of the damage.</p>

<p>319 Hinsch's Dental of the Veracity of Thome In order to destroy the affidavit of Thorne (Curt Thummel), Exhibit 977, Annex K, Hinsch attacks this affidavit at what he considers to be an essentially weak point. To get the complete picture it is necessary to give a brief resume of Thome's affidavit and his connection with this record. Thorne was the son of a German by name of Thummel, who had been a Lieutenant in one of the crack regiments in the German Army, and Thorne had a great many relatives in the German Army, his uncle and his uncle's sons. He came to this country in 1902 or 1903 and joined the Coast Guard in 1913 under the name of Thorne (Ex. 977, Ann. K. p. 4). At the beginning of the World War, his sympathies were with Germany, and he reported to the German Consul at Baltimore where he met the German officers of the ships which were interned at Baltimore, among whom was Hinsch (id. pp. 5, 6). Hinsch told Thorne that he, Hinsch, was working in the interests of Germany and was endeavoring to prevent the shipment of ammunition from this country to the Allies, and was trying to destroy munitions factories in this country, boats that were going out loaded with ammunition, and doing such other things as might be beneficial to Germany's cause (id. pp. 8, 9). At the Hotel Emerson bar Thorne was introduced by Hinsch to Herrmann under the name of Lewis. He visited Hinsch in Walbrook, a suburb of Balti- more, and Hinsch offered him a job, which he declined; but he resigned from the Coast Guard in May, 1916, and went to see Hinsch either on the interned steamer " Neckar ". or at the Emerson bar. A few days later he accepted from Hinsch a position as courier, taking messages from place to place, and for that purpose Hinsch secured for him a job as pantryman on the " St. Paul ", under the name of Chester Williams (id. pp. 9-14). After he had gotten this job, a man of Swedish appearance named Peterson or Anderson, whom he met through Hinsch, furnished him with a bundle of letters to be taken to England, and he was informed that there would be a return package. When he returned, the return package was brought to this Swedish man in sealed packages with no address. He made four trips on the " St. Paul ", the last leaving New York on August 26, 1916, and returning on September 17, 1916. He gave up the job as courier after the Swedish man told him there was nothing more to carry (id. p. 20). This Swedish man, named Peterson or Anderson, gave him a job in the Agency of Canadian Car &amp; Foundry Company plant at Kingsland, where he was employed as assistant employment manager through the recommendation of Anderson or Peterson. When he came back on his last trip Anderson told him that Hinsch was in New London so he went to New London on a Sunday and met Hinsch and several others in the Griswold Hotel. The testimony on that point is as follows (id. p. 21): " Yes, when I came back from the trip Anderson told me Hinsch was up in New London, and I immediately went up to New London, I think it was a Sunday if I remember right when I got in. I do not want to be held to the date, it is so long ago I cannot remember it, but it was a Sunday I think. I immediately went up to New London on the next train and met Hinsch and several others there at the Griswold. They were expecting the ' Bremen ' in, the submarine Bremen, and there was great excitement and giving parties, and everybody seemed to be very happy and expectant. I went up to see Hinsch and could not talk much to Hinsch because he was very busy with preparations for receiving the ' Bremen ', and he sent me back to New York that night to see Anderson, and that is how I came — and Anderson then told me to get employment in the munition plant — Anderson or Peterson, or whatever it is."

<p>As we will see later, this portion of Thome's statement is directly attacked by Hinsch's affidavit (Ger. Ann. 104, p. 4). Besides Hinsch, Thorne met Paul Hilken at the Griswold Hotel; but, as he had not been paid off for his work on the "St. Paul", being in New London on leave, he had to return and get his pay (Ex. 977, Ann. K, p. 22). His job at Kingsland was hiring men and assigning them to the different departments. He sometimes hired two hundred men a day, and Hinsch sent him at various times, men to be hired (id. p. 23). In December, 1916, or January, 1917, Hinsch sent him a man with a German name to be hired and he put him to work in the plant. He understood that the purpose for which Hinsch was putting these men in the plant was sabotage (id. pp. 23 and 24). This man, hired at Hinsch's request, asked for and received a transfer from one department to another. Before that time Hinsch had discussed at various times with Thorne the destruction of the Kingsland plant, the discussion taking place at Meyer's Hotel in Hoboken (id. p. 25). Hinsch mentioned Wozniak's name to Thorne but he never met Wozniak (id. p. 26). Thorne was in the plant when the fire occurred (id. p. 27). Three or four days after the fire he met Hinsch at the Hotel Astor and Hinsch said it was a good job that was done at Kingsland (id. pp. 28, 29). After the fire Thorne became associated with the German-American Employ- ment Agency in Newark, New Jersey, and this was done at the suggestion of Hinsch. They changed the name of the business and sent out hundreds of people to various munitions plants (id. pp. 29, 30). German Annex 104, executed by Hinsch on April 14, 1934, and filed April 16, 1935, was introduced for the specific purpose of contradicting Thome's affidavit. In this affidavit Hinsch summarized the important points of Thome's affidavit and denounced it as " a lie from beginning to end ". He denied that he had ever known Charles Thorne or Thummel, or that he had ever known any person employed in the Kingsland plant, or a man who was in a position to employ a worker there. He denied ever knowing a Swedish man called Peterson or Anderson; denied sending Thorne to Anderson or Peterson to be employed as a courier. The last statement in Hinsch's affidavit is as follows: " The allegation that in New London where Thorne claims to have arrived about September 17, 1916, he found my people in a happy and joyful mood is manifesty a lie too. At that time the ' Bremen ' had already been due for about 10 or 14 days, all of us were highly concerned as to what might have happened to her; nothing was more remote to our minds than to be in a happy mood and to arrange parties." The fact that Thorne correctly described conditions in New London on Sunday, September 17th, is abundantly proven by Exhibit 977, Annex U. That exhibit contains three pages from " The Day ", a daily newspaper published in New London, Connecticut. The first page is from the publication of Saturday afternoon, September 16, 1916, and contains an article, the headline for which is this: " THOUGHT U-</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">BOAT WAS IN HARBOUR".</h3>
<p>The article relates how the people were excited on State Street by the cry, "The Bremen is coming, the Bremen is coming! ", and relates that there was a grand rush in the direction of the water front. The object which caused the mistake was a floating fence, about 125 feet in length. Then the article goes on to state as follows: " The arrival of the undersea craft is now considered only a question of hours. Paul Hilken and other officials of the Eastern Forwarding Co. are here and all is ready for the big show. Collector of Customs James L. McGovern and numerous</p>

<p>321 newspapermen and photographers came in on the early afternoon trains. No information is available at the terminal, but the impression was strong late this afternoon that the merchantman is near at hand." The second sheet is for Monday afternoon, September 18th, and contains an article, the headlines for which are as follows: " BREMEN RUMORS STIR UP THE CITY". The article is in part as follows: " A wildly expectant throng lined the waterfront Sunday evening at 9 o'clock and positively identified every light shimmering in the outer harbor as the bow watch of the long anticipated German submersible. * * * " The brain storm was started by an apparently well authenticated report that the famous merchantman had been sighted off Ocean Beach. No sooner had the message reached the centre of the city than telephone wires began to buzz in every direction. Custom officials, moving picture operators, photographers, news- papermen and the general public hastened to the water's edge. * * * " Color was lent to the rumor by the fact that the Scott tug T. A. Scott, Jr., put out hastily with representatives of the Eastern Forwarding Co. on board. Evidently they were also of the impression that the submarine was close at hand. Right on the heels of the tug went Julius Fleischmann's yacht Whirlwind, carrying a heavy cargo of camera men and reporters." The third sheet is for Wednesday afternoon, September 20, 1916, and has the headlines: " WATCHFULLY WAIT FOR THE BREMEN ". It relates how the out-of-town and local newspapermen and photographers were getting weary, and recites the fact for three days the tugs of the T. A. Scott Co. had patroled the waters from Fishers Island to Montauk Point in a vain search. An examination of Exhibit 977, Annex S, affidavit of Paul G. L. Hilken, executed January 8, 1936, verifies beyond a doubt that the " Bremen " was not expected in New London before September 17th but that on that date she was expected. The " Bremen " did not leave the Weser estuary earlier than August 24th and probably not until the 25th or 26th of August. The " Deutschland " had taken 25 days for the crossing, and, on the same basis, it was calculated that the " Bremen " would be in New London on September 17th, and Hilken made his preparation for her arrival on September 17th, going to New London on September 16th. This is confirmed by the register of the Mohican Hotel which shows that on September 16th Hilken, Hoppenberg and Hammar registered at that hotel, and this is further confirmed by Hilken's diary, which shows that on Friday the 15th Hilken lunched at the Astor in New York and left New York at 4 p.m., arriving at New Haven at 8:30 p.m.; and on Saturday the 16th he left New Haven at 9:30 a.m. and arrived in New London at 11:05 ; had lunch in the " Willehad ", dinner at the " Mohican " and saw a bum show. It is further confirmed by entry in his diary for Sunday, the 17th, which shows that Wheeler, Reuterdahl, Schmidt, Hammar, Hoppenberg, and Hilken were at the Griswold Hotel and that he was at Hinsch's house for supper and he made this entry on his diary — " False alarm Bremen arrival ". The diary for Monday, September 18th, has the following entry, " Lunch Willehad Schmidt and I go out on tug ". In addition, in Exhibit 977, Annex S., Hilken annexes thereto a letter from his father, dated the 13th day of September, 1916, at Baltimore, written in German, a translation of which contains the following: " All cargo and stevedore tackel, etc. is now enroute excepting the contents of the barge ' George May ' which goes forward this afternoon as one carload.</p>
<p>322</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES'GERMANY</h3>
<p>" Prusse leaves to-morrow on Pennsylvania Railroad at 11.06 and is due at 3.13 in Pennsylvania station. If you have time you could take him to Grand Central Station, where he will take the 5 o'clock train. I have written Hinsch to meet him. However, I gave him detailed instructions regarding the transfer from one station to the other so that your help is not really necessary. Prusse has recovered and is happy to go to New London." The cargo and stevedore tackle, referred to in the letter, were for unloading the " Bremen". Mr. Prusse had come over on the " Deutschland " to supervise the operation of discharging and unloading the U-boats and did not leave Baltimore for New London until September 14, 1916, on which date he regis- tered at the Mohican Hotel, as is shown by the first sheet. Ann. A, to Exhibit 977, Ann. T. Hilken's affidavit also calls attention to the fact that Wheeler, of the Wheeler Syndicate, Inc., and Reuterdahl, an artist, came to New London on September 17, 1916, in order for Reuterdahl to make sketches of the "Bremen " as soon as she arrived, which sketches were to be distributed and published through the Wheeler Syndicate. Wheeler had already syndicated some sketches which Reuterdahl had made of the " Deutschland". Hilken's affidavit is further verified by the newspaper articles, which related that on Sunday, September 17th, around 9 p.m. a rumor came that the " Bre- men " was approaching the harbour and the tugboat " T . A. Scott, Jr." put out to meet the " Bremen ", following by a yacht containing reporters and camera- men. The tug remained out until early morning, and this was the first time anyone went out in expectation of meeting the " Bremen". These incidents and records show conclusively that Hinsch's deposition, German Annex 104, taken at Bremen April 14, 1934, was false, when he made the following closing statement : " The allegation that in New London where Thome claims to have arrived about September 17, 1916, he found my people in a happy and joyful mood is manifestly a lie too. At that time the ' Bremen ' had already been due for about 10 or 14 days, all of us were highly concerned as to what might have happened to her; nothing was more remote to our minds than to be in a happy mood and to arrange parties." It will be recalled that in making an affidavit designed to show that Hilken did not know Gerdts until he brought the Herrmann Message, Hinsch changed the affidavit as drafted by the German Agent so as to make it appear that theretofore Gerdts was unknown to " us " (Hilken and Hinsch) instead of unknown to " me " (Hinsch). In this affidavit designed to show that Thome was a liar, we have another example of Hinsch's changing the facts in his affidavit to meet the needed proof. Hinsch's False Claims That Geidts Was Unknown to Hilken and Himself Befou He Brought the Herrmann Message Fiom Mexico After the Herrmann message had been introduced in evidence, an affidavit was secured from Hinsch (Ger. Ann. 71). the object and purpose of which was to destroy the authenticity thereof by showing: (1) that Gerdts was unknown to both Hilken and Hinsch before the message was delivered, and (2) that the sole purpose of the message delivered by Gerdts was to introduce and identify Gerdts, and, therefore, the lengthy message (Ex. 904) was forged. In this affidavit (Ger. Ann. 71), Hinsch for the first time admits that Herrmann did in fact send a message in secret writing, through a messenger, to Hilken. and that this secret message was developed by Hilken (p. 1). He states that, in the spring of 1917, he was asked to go to Baltimore, and on a Sunday he visited</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>323 Hilken at his residence in Roland Park. Hilken showed him a book from which the imprinted white front or back flyleaf had been torn or cut out. a book printed in the English language. Hilken told him that the book had been brought to him by a man named Gerdts, " who had been unknown to us up until then"'. Hilken showed him the page containing the developed writing, on which something like the following English text could be read: " The bearer of this message is Raoul Gerdts who carries a personal message to you. You can trust him in full." In German Annex 132 there is a statement of the German Agent, and filed therewith is Exhibit C. containing a draft of the same deposition, which the German Agent, after a prior conference with Hinsch in Germany, had prepared in America and had returned to Germany for Hinsch's execution. The corres- ponding portion of the draft, as prepared by the German Agent, is as follows: " Hilken told me that this book had been brought to him by a man named Gerdts, who had been unknown to me up until then." The only change in the sentence as drawn and as executed was in the change of the word " me " underscored [emphasized] above, to " us ", by which Hinsch tried to persuade the Commission that Gerdts was unknown both to himself and to Hilken. In order further to prove that Gerdts was unknown both to himself and to Hilken before he brought the Herrmann message from Mexico to Baltimore, Hinsch changed the original form of the affidavit as prepared by the German Agent and added thereto the following: " Hilken reported that Gerdts had stated to him certain particulars with regard to the submarine enterprise, which only Herrmann could have known. I was then of the opinion that Gerdts had really come from Herrmann and was not, by any chance, an agent of the American Intelligence Service who had taken this book away from a messenger of Herrmann at the border." (Ger. Ann. 71, p. 4.) (Emphasis supplied.) All of these statements were afterthoughts and not in accordance with the facts. In Hinsch's affidavit of July 22, 1932 (Ger. Ann. 72. p. 3). he reiterates the statement: " Hilken and I saw Raoul Gerdts for the first time at the end of April, 1917, when he brought the message from Herrmann." An examination of the Hilken-Hoppenberg-Lowenstein correspondence, taken from the files of the Eastern Forwarding Company and filed September 13, 1938, with the brief of the American Agent, disproves Hinsch's claim. On January 13, 1917, Hilken had lunch with his friends, Hammar and Lo- wenstein, and, following that lunch, he on January 18. 1917, wrote Hoppenberg, his clerk in New York, a letter, mentioning the fact that Gerdts had called on him and Hoppenberg in New York on Saturday, January 13, 1917; and he requests Hoppenberg, if Gerdts should return to the office, to send him to Lowenstein " with the enclosed letter of introduction". In the enclosed letter of introduction Hilken, on January 18, 1917. recalls to Lowenstein that he had spoken to him at lunch on Saturday, January 13th, " about a young Spanish- American German, who speaks German and Spanish fluently and some Eng- lish". He goes on to state that the " letter will serve to introduce the young man, Mr. Raoul Gerdts ; should you have an opening in your works, I shall appreciate your considering his application". The reply of Lowenstein on January 30, 1917, acknowledged Hilken's letter and shows that Gerdts had called on Lowen- stein. Lowenstein writes Hilken:</p>
<p>324</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>" I have asked this young man to write me a letter explaining what he can do and I shall try my best to place him with one of my interests." Thus it will be seen that in January, 1917, before America entered the war, before Herrmann and Gerdts had left America for Mexico, and less than five months before Gerdts came back to Baltimore with the Herrmann message, Gerdts was so well known to Hilken that he was recommending him to his intimate friend, Lowenstein, for a job, and that he gave Gerdts a letter of introduction to Lowenstein. When Gerdts came to Baltimore with the Herrmann message, he was a guest in Hilken's home in Roland Park (unwelcome to Mrs. Hilken) for two or three days, and he amused himself with the piano player (Ex. 972). Hinsch confirms this statement as follows: " As I entered Hilken's home, a man not known to me was sitting at the piano in an adjoining room, who afterwards was introduced to me by Hilken as Gerdts." (Ger. Ann. 71, pp. 3, 4) Hilken's check stub books on his Corn Exchange Account show the following payments to Gerdts under the name of Raoul Sala : "No. 206 Date Apr 27 1917 Pay to A S &amp; Co For a/c Raoul Sala 175 " " No. 207 Date Apr 30 1917 Pay to A Schumacher &amp; Co For do 1000 " (Ex. 909, 61ed May 27, 1932). Hilken testified that the foregoing entries referred to checks drawn by him to the order of the firm A. Schumacher &amp; Co. for cash payments which he made to Raoul Gerdts shortly after the time Gerdts brought the Herrmann message to him in Baltimore (Ex. 909). The following entries in Hilken's 1917 diary fix the date that Hilken and Hinsch left New London as Saturday, April 28, 1917, and the date that Hinsch and Hilken had dinner with Gerdts in Roland Park as Sunday, April 29, 1917 : Entry for Saturday, April, 28th, reads: " 4 a. m. with Capt. H. leave l i a . m. train and Congressional for Baltimore ". Entry for Sunday, April 29th, reads : " Capt. H &amp; Cousin Raoul dine with us Roland Park " (Ex. 583, Ann. D. Rec. pp. 2330, 2331). Hilken in his testimony under subpoena of September, 1933, identifies the «ntry " Cousin Raoul " in his diary as follows: " In my diary for Sunday, April 29, 1917, there is a notation which bears out my recollection of a dinner at my house in Roland Park, which says, ' Captain H. and Cousin Raoul dined with us at Roland Park.' I remember that we called Raoul Gerdts ' Cousin Raoul ', because we have distant cousins in Venezuela. And so that the children, which were then of an age beginning to take notice, would not be suspicious, we introduced him to them as ' Cousin Raoul ', and they all called him ' Cousin Raoul.' " (Ex. 976, Ann. E, p. 121) Hinsch in his affidavit of June 28, 1932 (Ger. Ann. 71, p. 5), confirms the payment at this time of $1,000 to Gerdts in the following language:</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">DÉCISIONS</h3>
<p>325 " Hilken and I then decided that Gerdts should receive 8 1,000, which Hilken first had to withdraw from his bank. Gerdts was to inform Herrmann that I would go to Mexico in a short time and would bring money with me." In Hinsch's affidavit of July 22, 1932 (Ger. Ann. 72, p. 3). he reiterates the statement that: " Hilken and I saw Raoul Gerdts for the first time at the end of April, 1917, when he brought the message from Herrmann.'" The foregoing record discloses the following facts showing the relations between Hilken and Gerdts: On January 13, 1917, Hilken knew Gerdts well enough to speak about him to his friend, Lowenstein, at lunch; and on January 18th, Hilken gave Gerdts a letter of introduction to Lowenstein and a recommendation for a position. On Friday, April 27th, Hilken gave Gerdts $175.00, and on that same date he became a guest in Hilken's home while Hilken went to New London to see Hinsch. When Hilken and Hinsch returned on Sunday, they found Gerdts still a guest in the home and unwelcome to Mrs. Hilken on account of his cigarette smoking and piano playing. On that date, Sunday, April 29th, Hinsch and Gerdts dined with Hilken in his home in Roland Park, and Hilken and Hinsch decided to give Gerdts 81,000 and send him back to Mexico. On the following day, Monday. April 30th, Hilken gave to Gerdts the sum of $1.000 for Herrmann, and Hinsch sent him to Mexico with a message that he would soon follow with the balance of the money requested by Herrmann. Surely, in the light of this record, neither Hinsch nor Hilken needed any state- ments in the message or disclosures by Gerdts, revealing a knowledge of par- ticulars about the submarine enterprise, to convince them that Gerdts was not " an agent of the American Intelligence Service, who had taken this book away from a messenger of Herrmann at the border ''. The change made by Hinsch in the affidavit as originally drawn by the German Agent shows that Hinsch was willing to fabricate statements in order to make the affidavit conform with the needed proof. (6) Testimony of Willie Woehst In the history of sabotage by German agents, Woehst is not an important ligure, in comparison with Hilken, Hinsch or Herrmann. Most of his affidavits were introduced for the specific purpose of substantiating Hinsch's affidavits, prepared for the purpose of destroying the confessions of Herrmann and Hilken and refuting other statements in the record connecting Hilken, Herrmann and Hinsch with sabotage. In order, therefore, to test the accuracy and truthfulness of Woehst's affidavits, it is necessary first to examine the record and ascertain therefrom what were Herrmann's statements towards which Woehst's affidavits were directed. In Exhibit 729, Rec. p. 4865 et seq., Edwin Herrmann, the brother of Fritz Herrmann, told of Fritz Herrmann's several trips to Germany and of his meeting with Nadolny and Marguerre and William Kottkamp. He stated that Fritz came back to this country and made arrangements with Kottkamp for opening in New York an office under the name of" European Textile Company ", which was a blind for importing incendiary devices into the United States for use against ships and for operations against munition factories (id. p. 4869). He also stated that Willie Woehst (who was known as '" Rupp " and " Hau- ten "). Clucas. Thome, Raoul Gerdts, Kurt Jahnke, Lothar Witzke. Paul 22</p>
<p>326</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>Hilken, Hinsch, Wozniak, and Siegel were all known to him personally (id. pp. 4869-4870) ; that Fritz, Woehst and some of the others had an apartment located on the wesi side of New York City in the Luxor Apartment house and had another apartment in Newark, New Jersey (id. p. 4870) ; that Woehst spent considerable time at the Prince George Hotel in New York as well as at the Hotel Me Alpin. He identified the letter, Annex 1-1 to Hilken's affidavit (Ex. 583), as having been signed by his brother, Fritz Herrmann. Frederick or Fritz Herrmann in his examination by the two agents, April 3, 1930, Rec. p. 5431 et seq., testified as follows about Woehst: Woehst arrived in this country on November 27, 1916 (Ex. 995, Anns. B &amp; C) ; and met Herrmann shortly thereafter (Rec. p. 5451). He told Herrmann that he came from the General Staff with instructions to report to Hilken and through Hilken to get in touch with Hinsch and Herrmann " about blowing up these things " (id. p. 5489). Herrmann was not sure whether Woehst brought tubes with him, but he was sure that Carl Dilger brought several hundred in a trunk with a false side or bottom (id. p. 5489). Woehst told Herrmann that he had left a package of tubes with Hinsch, and Woehst also brought over some new germs at the same time (id. p. 5582). Woehst reported that his instructions were the same as Herrmann had gotten, namely, to get in touch with Hinsch and Herrmann for the purpose of destroying munition plants. Woehst, Herrmann and Gerdts were all under suspicion as alleged German secret agents early in 1917 (See report of A. G. Adams to Department of Justice, dated February 21, 1917, Ex. 583, Ann. K, Rec. p. 2359; also report of John Kaba to the Department of Justice dated May 19, 1917, Ann. X to Ex. 583, Rec. p. 2406 et seq. ; also report dated May, 33, 1917, Ann. Y to Ex. 583, Rec, p. 2410 et seq.). When the World War started, Woehst was employed by the shipping concern, D. Fuhrmann, in Hamburg as manager of the department, Hamburg-Boston and Hamburg-New Orleans, having been employed by the firm about ten years. In German Exhibit CXXIV, Woehst gave his personal history, stated he had visited the United States in 1902 and 1903 1 and told of his experience in the war until he was taken ill (pp. 4, 5). He then reported to Berlin and was sent to the Great General Staff, " Sektion Politik " (p. 5), and on account of his. knowledge of English, was selected for the purpose of going to Italy via America, to appear as a German-American. After being specially trained for propaganda activities in Italy and being instructed in the Intelligence Service, deciphering secret codes, writing with invisible ink and developing letters written with in- visible ink, he was called to Berlin and received an order to go by the quickest route via Norway to New York (id. p. 7). He reported to Captain Marguerre who instructed him to call on Paul Hilken in Baltimore in order to get assistance in obtaining a visa for Italy on a false passport (id. p. 8). He left Germany on his trip on October 1st or 2nd, 1916, booked passage by a Danish steamer, " Frederick VIII ", appeared on the passenger list under the name of Hermann Rupp with a false Swiss passport and arrived in America in the beginning of November,2 1916. He then went to Baltimore, met Paul Hilken and asked him to assist in obtaining a visa for Italy, but found that that was not possible, because a law had been promulgated which provided for a sharp control of passport visas to belligerent countries (id. pp. 11, 16, 17). 1 At the time of this visit, he enlisted in the U. S. Navy but deserted after eight months' service (Ex. 583, Ann. Y, p. 2411). 2 He arrived Nov. 27, 1916 (Ex. 995, Anns. B &amp; C).</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">DÉCISIONS</h3>
<p>327 As he could not get a passport to Italy, he stayed in America, was introduced by Hilken to Herrmann and became a close friend of Herrmann and lived with him a considerable time and he also became well acquainted with Hilken. He did not know and was not informed that Hilken worked for the Great General Staff (id. p. 12). Hilken placed Hoppenberg's office in New York at Woehst's disposal (id. p. 20). Hilken's reason for introducing Herrmann to Woehst was that the second U-boat trip had come to an end, and, therefore, Hilken had nothing for Herr- mann to do; so Hilken thought it would be best for Woehst to " take him " and try to find something to do together (id. p. 31). He tried to get some employment from Hilken in connection with the " U-Deutschland " work and went to New London between November 20th and 25th and met Hilken in the Mohican Hotel. He was introduced at this time by Hilken to Capta,in Hinsch at New London (id. pp. 23-25). In order to meet the affidavits of Herrmann, Hilken and Edwin Herrmann, Woehst made the following denials : (1) that he ever received instructions in Berlin to be carried out in event he had to remain in America (id. p. 42) ; (2) that he had ever planned to destroy munitions supplies or have them destroyed by others (id. pp. 52, 53) ; (3) that he had ever employed people to blow up munitions factories or munitions supplies or to bring about fires (id. p. 53); (4) that Herrmann ever told him that he, Herrmann, had carried on sabotage against munitions factories or munitions supplies, or that he had blown up any- thing, or that he and Hinsch had carried on sabotage in America (id. p. 53) ; (5) that he ever possessed devices for bringing about fires, or small glass tubes, or that he had seen or heard of small glass tubes, or that he had ever seen them in Herrmann's possession (id. pp. 54, 55) ; (6) that Herrmann had ever shown him such devices or ever talked to him about such incendiary devices (id. p. 55) ; (7) or that he had ever seen such devices as were sketched by Herrmann as Exhibits 1 &amp; 2 with his testimony (id. p. 56). Woehst further denied : (1) that Hinsch was ever mentioned in connection with the Black Tom ex- plosion (id. p. 57); (2) that he had ever discussed the Black Tom explosion with Herrmann (id. p. 57); (3) that he ever became acquainted with Witzke, Jahnke or Kristoff (id. p. 57); (4) or that he had ever met Theodore J. Wozniak (id. p. 59), or Rodriguez (id. p. 60). He further denied: (1) that Herrmann ever told him anything about the Kingsland plant; that he knew anything about the place, or that he ever discussed with anybody setting fire to that factory, or that he discussed the same with Herrmann, or that he ever proposed to Herrmann to undertake sabotage against munitions factories, or that he ever came in contact with laborers who were employed in munitions factories in order to cause sabotage acts through them (id. pp. 60, 61); (2) he further denied that he ever introduced Wozniak to Herrmann (id. 61 ) ; (3) or that he ever heard that Herrmann cooperated with a man named Wozniak or with a man named Rodriguez (id. p. 61); (4) or that either Herrmann or Hinsch had anything to do with the Kings- land fire (id. pp. 61, 62, 63);</p>

New York (Ger. Ex. XCI). Woehst claimed that the only subject he took up with Hilken was in regard to obtaining a passport with an Italian visa (Ger. Ex.

Woehst further claimed that his activities, after he found out he could not get to Italy, were, in connection with Herrmann, to ascertain the movement of munitions over the various piers for transfer to transatlantic steamers (Ger. Ex. CXXIV, p. 41). These activities began about the first days of December, but he (Woehst) took his instructions from nobody and specifically did not receive instructions in Berlin to be carried out in the event he had to remain in America (id. p. 42). Marguerre testified that he gave Woehst no instructions for agents in America ; and that he gave him no instructions for America, in case he would not be successful in getting to Italy, and that when Woehst returned and reported that he could not get to Italy, he was dismissed immediately " because he was a failure in our eyes " (Ger. Ex. CXXIII, Exam, of Aug. 1. 1930, p. 14). Woehst's " unauthorized " activities, he says, were carried on at night, prin- cipally in the freight yards of the Lehigh Valley. New York Central and the Hoboken switching yards, and reports were sent by telegram to the Admiralty Staff (Ger. Ex. CXXIV, pp. 42, 43). He saw Herrmann daily and Herrmann was not engaged in any other matters of secret service nor did Herrmann receive any moneys whatsoever from Hilken or carry on any sabotage work in America of any kind (id. pp. 47, 51-53). Woehst's affidavits show a meticulous study of the record and were designed to deny every fact which would connect Hilken and Herrmann with sabotage. As we have seen above, Hilken stated that when he met Woehst in Baltimore he recommended to him the Prince George Hotel in New York and that Woehst stayed there a while and moved to the McAlpin (Ex. 976, Ann. E, pp. 90, 91). As we also have seen, Edwin Herrmann, the brother of Frederick Herrmann, also testified that Woehst spent considerable time at the Prince George Hotel in New York as well as at the Hotel McAlpin (Ex. 729, Rec. p. 4871).' The question as to whether Woehst ever stopped at the Prince George Hotel would not seem to be important enough to dignify it with a denial; but the record was searched for an opportunity to contradict Hilken and Herrmann, and.</p></div>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>329 therefore. Woehst was particular specifically to deny this statement. See German Exhibit XCI where he says: " Entirely untrue is the statement concerning my stay at the Prince George Hotel in New York. I never entered the said hotel." In Exhibit 733-B, Rec. p. 4894, there is a letter dated December 19, 1916, written by Edwin W. Hauten (Woehst) to March (Herrmann) in which the following sentence occurs : " I am staying at Hotel McAlpin not at Prince George, which was impossible on some reason." Thus the record seems to verify the statements of Hilken and Edwin Herrmann and to contradict the statements of Woehst on this point. Woehst testified that he was with Herrmann so frequently and constantly, that, outside of making investigations of the movements of munitions across the piers to translatante steamers, Herrmann did not attend to any other matter of the secret service, and that he could not have done so (Ger. Ex. CXXIV, pp. 46. 47). Before the United States entered the World War, Woehst was under the suspicion of Federal agents, and on February 24, 1917, they found in his room a letter from Herrmann addressed to Whoest containing the following: " Dear Hauten [Woehst's alias] — " If letters come for me from Perth Amboy, open them &amp; heat them. If there is any news, you can forward it to the right party. * * * If you think it best that he discontinue the work there just write a short letter to Mr. E. Adams, Hotel Madison, Perth Amboy, New Jersey. * • * ." (Ex. 583, Ann. I, Rec. p. 2356.) As indicated by the report of Department ofjustice agent Stone dated October 19, 1918, the date of the " Dear Hauten " letter is undoubtedly around February 2, 1917. Stone reports that an inspection by him of the Hotel Madison, Perth Amboy, New Jersey, disclosed the fact that " E. Adams, Newark, N . J . " was registered on February 2, 1917 (Ex. 593, Rec. p. 2489). On the sheet containing this letter, there were the names of ammunition plants, as to which Hilken testified later that they had them " on the spot " (Ex. 976, Ann. E, pp. 95, 99). The reference to " heating " the letters refers to the fact that Herrmann was expecting letters to be written in lemon juice. Such letters Woehst is directed to develop by heat (id. p. 98). When this letter was shown to Woehst. he pretended not to know whether the letter was genuine; but he claimed that the letter could not have had " any connection with acts of destruction of an ammunition plant, since Herr- mann, as long as I knew him, did not engage in such activities." (Ger. Ann. 22 (a), p. 6.) This letter substantiates Herrmann's testimony as to Woehst's participation in sabotage, and also shows that Woehst was testifying falsely when he claimed that Herrmann never operated apart from him. This claim is also disproved by a letter written by Woehst to Herrmann on December 19, 1916. containing the following: " I tried to get you to-day but failed * * *. I am staying at Hotel McAlpin not at Prince George, which was impossible on some reason." (Ex. 733-B, Rec. p. 4894.) As Woehst registered at the McAlpin for the first time on December 11, 1916 (See Ex. 938). and Woehst notified Herrmann on December 19. 1916, that he</p>
<p>330</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>was staying at that hotel, it would seem clear that for eight days, at least, Woehst was not in contact with Herrmann. Woehst claimed that on December 11, 1916, he again took " lodging at the Hotel McAlpin on coming from Rochester " (Ger. Ann. 76, p. 2). He had been in Rochester four days; therefore we must conclude that on the 19th of December, 1916, Woehst and Herrmann had not been associ- ating with each other for a period of at least twelve days. It was during this period that Herrmann was having his meetings with Wozniak and Wozniak was writing his letters to the Russian authorities (Rec. pp. 5452-5455, 5499-5503, 5589, 5623; Ex. 725, (4) and (5), Rec. pp. 4554, 4556). How often did Woehst see Hinsch? In March, 1930, before the Herrmann confession, Woehst testified that he saw and spoke to Hinsch in Baltimore and New York three or four times, and that he did not know whether Hinsch had anything to do with the affairs of secret service (Ger. Ex. XCI, p. 3). In attempting to destroy Herrmann's confession, Hinsch denied that he had been in New York at all during the time that Woehst and Herrmann were associated with each other, to wit, from early in December, 1916, to February 14, 1917 (Ger. Ex. CXXVIII, pp. 79 et seq.). In July, 1930, Woehst made an affidavit for the purpose of bolstering up Hinsch's affidavits and of contradicting Herrmann's confession. In that affidavit he stated that, after thinking the matter over, he had concluded that his prior affidavit was erroneous and that he had become certain that he had met Hinsch only once, and that it was in New London, not New York, and it was in the Mohican Hotel " between November 20 and 25 ", where he claimed that he stayed under the name of Edw. W. Hauten. He also claimed that Hilken had reserved a room at the Mohican and he met Hilken there (Ger. Ex. CXXIV, pp. 24-28). An examination of the register of the Mohican Hotel for the period fails to disclose that Woehst registered there under his own name or under his aliases, Hauten or Rupp (Ex. 976, Ann. Q_). Hilken was not in New London between November 19 and the evening of November 24, 1916 (Ex. 911 ; Ex. 976, Ann. E, p. 93). Woehst did not arrive in the United States until November 27, 1916; and between November 20 and November 25, 1916, he was on the high seas on board S. S. " Frederick VIII ", with a false passport in the name of Hermann Rupp (Ex. 995, Anns. B and C). Woehst testified that he disembarked at Hoboken in the beginning of November, 1916 (Ger. Ex. CXXIV, pp. 10, 11). As to the date of his arrival he was, as we have seen above, mistaken since he did not get to the United States until November 27, 1916. After disembarking at Hoboken he testified that he stayed for two days in New York arranging some personal matters in connection with the shipping concern, D. Fuhrmann (id. pp. 13, 14). He then went to Baltimore where he stayed four or five days and claims to have seen Paul Hilken on or about the 5th or 6th of November (id. pp. 15-17). During the month of November, 1916, Hilken was only in Baltimore from the evening of 21st to the morning of the 23rd and again on the 30th — Thanksgiving (1916 diary, Ex. 911). How Woehst became mixed upon his dates is not clear from the record, but it is clear that he was not in New London between November 20th and 25th and that he did not meet Hinsch in New London between those dates. Woehst's Movements after the Kingsland Fire In April, 1930, Herrmann testified that Woehst went to Rochester with incen- diary devices (Rec. p. 5581). Later in his examination of October, 1933, Herrmann spoke of Woehst's nervousness after the Kingsland fire, as a result of which he left town (Ex. 986, Ann A, pp. 93 - 94). Woehst's testimony is directly</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>331 to the contrary. In July, 1930, and in August, 1932, Woehst testified that when he came from Rochester on December 11, 1916, he stayed continuously at the Hotel McAlpin up to the time when he moved to the apartment house on January 20, 1917 (Ger. Ex. GXXIV, p. 33; Ger. Ann. 76, p. 2). On the day following Herrmann's flight from the United States to Mexico, an agent of the Department of Justice searched Herrmann's room and found therein a telegram, sent by Woehst from Rochester to Herrmann at the McAlpin Hotel, dated January 16, 1917 (Ex. 583, Ann. N, Rec. p. 2368), thus proving the falsity of Woehst's claim, and corroborating Herrmann. It is thoroughly established, also, by Woehst's own cousin, Hildegarde Can- field (née Jacobsen) that immediately after the Kingsland fire, Woehst was nervous and persuaded her to spend the week end with him at Montclair Hotel, in Montclair, N. J., after which they spent several days in Rochester, N. Y. At that time Woehst practically admitted some complicity in, and responsibility for, the fire (Ex. 995, Ann. A, p. 3). Subsequently in Germany, Woehst referred to his false testimony and regretted that he had not been in a position to tell the truth (id. pp. 4, 5). His conduct as to the spots appearing on Hildegarde's face showed that he feared he had infected her with some of the disease germs he had been handling (id. p. 4). As indicated elsewhere, Woehst, Herrmann and Gerdts were under suspicion by the Department of Justice shortly before and after the United States entered the war, and were the subject of several reports by A. G. Adams, Special Agent (Rec. pp. 2359 et seq.), and by John Kaba, Special Agent (Rec. p. 2406 etseq.). In the course of his investigation, Kaba met Mary Hildegarde Jacobsen of Rochester, New York, and on May 23rd, 1917, made a report of an interview which was held by Special Agent Adams in Kaba's presence, Rec. p. 2410. Mary Hildegarde, who later married one Canfield, in 1930 made a visit to Germany. Under date of May 31, 1935, she made an affidavit which was filed as Exhibit 995, Annex A. The contemporaneous Kaba report and the 1935 affidavit of Jacobsen-Can- field disclose a set of facts which entirely contradict Woehst in his denials of the statement of Herrmann and Hilken. In the Kaba report it appears that Miss Jacobsen was introduced to Woehst, her first cousin, by her father at the Pennsylvania station in New York just after Woehst arrived from Baltimore early in December, 1916. The details of this report connected Woehst with Herrmann and Gerdts as German agents who had fled from America and gone to Mexico and disclose the fact tht Raoul Gerdts had recently come from Mexico and looked Miss Jacobsen up at her apartment, 106 West 13th Street, and asked if she had had some money from Willie Woehst. The statement further disclosed the fact that, on the day Woehst returned to Germany, Herrmann told her she would receive a large sum of money from Willie Woehst which she should deposit in bank until called for by him or Raoul, and she was to explain the receipt of this money by stating it had been left to her by a deceased relative in Germany. She told of seeing Woehst using invisible ink on a letter written in a regular way and he explained to her the process of making the same legible. Woehst spoke of March (Herrmann) as stupid look- ing, but very shrewd and able, and one who had done good work in Europe. Woehst rented a furnished apartment in New Jersey and sent March to live in it. The night before Woehst left he, Herrmann, Miss Jacobsen and a Miss Mc- Pherson had a party together in Woehst's apartment. In the affidavit given by Mary Hildegarde Canfield in 1935 (Ex. 995, Ann. A), she explained that when she made the Kaba statement she was concerned about the investigations</p>

<p>" because / knew that my cousin had been acting secretly for the German Government in preventing shipment of munitions, and that he had been connected in some way with the blowing up of a munitions factory. I was very much afraid not only that what I might say would result in harm to him but also to myself because of my knowledge of what had been done. On that account, the information which I gave in May 1917 was limited insofar as it was possible for me to do so under the pressure and threats to which I was subjected by Department of Justice officials." (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">(P- I-)</h3>
<p>She told of her trip to Germany in April, 1930, with her two children, where she stayed until May, 1931. While in Germany she met her cousin. Willie Woehst, a number of times. She stated that she learned Willie Woehst was in the United States in November, 1916, and met him about Thanksgiving, and that shortly thereafter Woehst visited her father and mother in Rochester. She then stated as follows : " My cousin first told me that he had come here in connection with the paying off of various German seamen whose vessels were interned in the United States, but after a short time it rapidly became apparent that this was only a subterfuge for his real purpose. He had plenty of money to spend, and finally himself admitted that he had come to this country on orders from the German Government, to try to stop the shipment of all kinds of war materials which were being sent from the United States to the English and French. He maintained that his activities were directed against Germany's enemies and not against the United States. " As he became more frank, Wilhelm Woehst told me that he was associated with Paul Hilken and Fritz March, the latter of whom he stated was a very success- ful German spy and had worked with great distinction in England during 1915. Woehst also stated that March, whose real name was Herrmann, was one of the most active of those engaged in destructive work in the United States and in fact painted such a glowing picture of Herrmann's fearlessness and daring that it was at my request that I was introduced to Herrmann, on an occasion which I distinctly remember, on the mezzanine floor of the McAlpin Hotel. I cannot remember the exact date, and have no records to fix it, but I do know that I met Herrmann before Christmas 1916." (Emphasis supplied.) (pp. 2, 3.) She met Herrmann on several occasions and he spent considerable time in Perth Amboy and made a trip to Savannah and telegrams were sent by Herr- mann to Woehst from Savannah. After Woehst returned from Rochester in December, she saw him practically every day until immediately after the fire and explosions of munitions which took place in Kingsland, New Jersey, in January,</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-1916"><span class="para-num">1916.</span><p>Then she states: " On the morning following that fire, Woehst called at the Three Arts Club at about 9 a. m., and told me that it was important for him to leave town at least for a few days and he wanted me to go with him. He was very insistent on going somewhere where there were few people, and where it was quiet. I inquired the reason for this and Woehst referred to the article in the newspaper about the fire. I asked him ifhe had anything to do with it, and he avoided a direct reply shrugging his shoulders and laughing, f1] " Although Woehst did not at that time tell me whether he had been implicated in the fire, yet his actions and manner convinced me that he knew who had been responsible for it, and that it was desirable for him to get away for a few days. I went with him to Montclair and stayed at the Hotel Montclair for three days, over a week-end from Friday morning until Sunday night. The hotel had a large open fireplace and a skating rink on the pond at the foot of the hill. " On the Sunday night we rushed off to Rochester, N. Y., because spots had appeared on my face and my cousin was afraid that I had contracted an infection from him, 1 This confirms the statements previously made by Herrmann as to Woehst s nervous condition and visit to Rochester immediately after the Kingsland explosion (Ex. 986, Ann. A, pp. 93, 94).</p></div>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>333 as he said that he had been handling some materials which might give me an infection, and which might have serious consequences. On this account my cousin refused to permit me to go to a doctor in New York but took me immediately to Rochester where I was examined by our family doctor. My cousin was tremendously relieved when the doctor diagnosed my complaint as German measles." (Emphasis supplied.) (pp. 3, 4.) She further states that soon after arrival in Germany in the spring of 1930 she spent a few days at Altona and visited her cousin, Willie Woehst, and his family. She stayed at a hotel and not at their home. Then she states as follows: " I found that my cousin was greatly worried over the fact that Hilken had accused him of sending blackmailing letters after the war, and he said that in view of those statements by Hilken, he, Woehst, might suffer severe punishment in Germany. Before leaving Germany in 1931 I saw Woehst again and he told me that he had been able to 'square himself with his Government, in respect to Hilken's statements, f1] Woehst said that he was thoroughly disgusted with the whole business and gave me to understand that if he could have secured employment outside of Germany he would have been glad to have told the full truth about his activities in America. " Woehst told me that under the circumstances he had no alternative but to deny any knowledge of the Kingsland fire and of any other unlawful activities of Herrmann and Hilken in the United States." (Emphasis supplied.) (pp. 4, 5.) Thus it appears from the Kaba report and Mrs. Canfield's affidavit that nearly all of the statements made by Hilken and Herrmann and denied by Woehst were admitted by him to Mrs. Canfield (née Jacobsen). With claimants' Exhibit 583, examination of Paul G. L. Hilken, December 7th-19th, 1928, there were filed as Annexes AA-1 and BB, a letter from Woehst to Hilken, Sr., dated December 4, 1920. translated at Rec. p. 2287, and another letter dated May 9, 1921, to Paul Hilken, translated at Rec. p. 2290. The first letter reads in part as follows: " I hope that you have in the meantime come into the possession of my letter of eight days ago. I have made an effort in Berlin to find out from the former gentlemen of the Great General Staff, whether there is any possibility of having refunded to me by the German Government my personal property which I lost abroad. I regret to say that these gentlemen can give me little hope, as this Department was dissolved immediately after the outbreak of the revolution, and all papers were burned at once. Mow, as at that time your son gave an order on Berlin to send for us $15,000, and as this remittance arrived too late (after the outbreak of the diplomatic relations), this money could not be used and must therefore still lie to the credit of Mr. Paul Hilken's account. Of course the money cannot be returned to the former Department as the former existence of this department naturally is not now to be spoken of. I would be extremely grateful to you if you could persuade your son to pay me, out of this account, the amount of my account which was seized abroad. If you consider that it is not a large sum, probably about $1,000, as I find myself in grave necessity on account of my family of four. I see no other means and ask you to help me in this matter at once. The gentlemen of the former staff have helped me with the best will, and from a charity fund have paid me a small sum, which, of course, will last only a short while. I have received from Capt. P. Koenig who has become nautical director in Bremen, a letter in which he expresses the wish that I may be successful in recovering my property which was seized abroad. It is probably out of the question for me to expect the American Government to pay this to me as I lived under a different name while there." (Emphasis supplied.) The second letter to Paul Hilken reads as follows: " As I unfortunately have received no answer from you to my last letter, I was forced ro hand in my claim for damages to the proper authorities for foreign claims, and / have been asked by them to submit a confirmation, that I was active in New York and 1 This was probably effected by his affidavit confirming Hinsch (Ger. Ex. CXXIV).</p>
<p>334</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>Baltimore from October 1916 until February 1917. I request you, therefore, to confirm this so that I will be able to use your statement with the Department in question. " I would not like to bring the gentlemen, Marguerre, Capt. von Hiilsen and Mr. Nadolny into difficulties, and, therefore, must ask you for your assistance. " Respectfully " Willy Wohst Altona Molkestrasse 22. " P. S. In case I do not receive this confirmation from you I am unfortunately forced to make my demands for payment from the funds (G. G. St.) of that period." (Emphasis supplied.) In the light of this record, it is clear that Woehst was making false statements when he claimed that he was not authorized by the gentlemen of the Great General Staff to carry on any activities in America and did not carry on such activities. His plea that he was ignorant of sabotage activities is likewise dis- proven. His ignorance of the activities of Herrmann and Hinsch can no longer be maintained, and his claim that he was ignorant of enterprises to infect horses or mules with anthrax germs must likewise be classified as false. Although he claimed that the maximum amount of money received by him from Hilken was $1,000, he makes the claim in his letter to Hilken, Sr., that Paul Hilken had given an order " on Berlin to send for us S 15,000, and as this remittance arrived too late (after the outbreak of the diplomatic relations), this money could not be used and must therefore still lie to the credit of Mr. Paul Hilken's account." And in the same letter he argues that as Paul Hilken has in his account $15,000 " which cannot be returned to the former Department, as the former existence of this Department is not now to be spoken of" therefore Paul Hilken has the money with which to reimburse him for the loss of his personal possessions. He claims to have been sent to America simply for the purpose of getting a visa on a false passport to Italy, but he endeavors in 1921 to secure from Hilken a confirmation " that I was active in New York and Baltimore from October 1916 until February 1917 ", and he gives as his reasons for asking Hilken's assistance on this point that " I would not like to bring the gentlemen, Mar- guerre, Capt. von Hiilsen and Mr. Nadolny into difficulties ". Although, as we have seen above, Marguerre testified that he gave Woehst no instructions as to activities in America and he dismissed Woehst upon his return " because he was a failure in our eyes," we now have Woehst endeavor- ing to secure a portion of $15,000 of money coming from " Sektion Politik ", in payment of his activities " in New York and Baltimore from October, 1916 until February, 1917 ". It will also be noted that when Woehst presented to the German Government his claim for damages, he had been asked to submit a confirmation that he was " active in New York and Baltimore from October, 1916, until February, 1917 ", and he requested Paul Hilken to confirm this activity, so that he might be able to use Hilken's statement with the Department in question, and significantly he adds: " I would not like to bring the gentlemen Marguerre, Gapt. von Hiilsen and Mr. Nadolny into difficulties " and in the postscript he says: " In case I do not receive this confirmation from you I am unfortunately forced to make my demands for payment from the funds (G. G. St.) of that period." (Rec. pp. 2290-2291).</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">DÉCISIONS</h3>
<p>335 Another letter written by Woehst to Hilken was lost, but according to Hilken it was very sharp in its demands (Ex. 583, Rec. p. 2291). Those letters, denominated by Hilken as " blackmailing ", 1 were introduced into the record on December 19, 1928 (Ex. 583, Rec. pp. 2287, 2290), but were not made the subject of any comment by Woehst in any of his four examinations — affidavit of August 24, 1929 (Ger. Ann. 22 (a)); affidavit of March 11, 1930 (Ger. Ex. XCI) ; deposition of July 24, 25, 1930 (Ger. Ex. CXXIV) ; or affidavit of July 8, 1932 (Ger. Ann. 76), or by Marguerre in either his affidavit of July 17, 1929 (Ger. Ann. 22), or his deposition of July 30, Aug. 1, 1930 (Ger. Ex. CXXIII), each filed after February 9. 1929, the date of filing of Ex. 583; and they not only convict Woehst of" blackmailing ", but they also convict Woehst and Marguerre of falsifying the record when they claimed that Woehst had no authority for his activities in America. How Woehst's Expenses in This Country Were Paid In German Exhibit CXXIV, p. 14, Woehst testified that when he came to this country he exchanged in New York his Swiss money which the General Staff had given him, about four or five thousand francs, into American money and it netted him only about $650. This was the amount given him by the General Staff to cover his expenses of travelling from Germany to Italy via the United States; and he received no other money for this purpose. He had, how- ever, about $250 " and about eight hundred to one thousand German Reich- marks " of his own money. He was asked whether he received money from anybody else, and he stated that he was " an employee of the shipping concern Fuhrmann and could have raised money from the Gans Line ", but he was " not entirely sure " that he raised money there. He believed he did let the Gans line pay only his expenses in connection with his private business of the S. S. " Hohenfelde ". At page 49 he was asked: " How did you pay your living expenses during your stay in America? " A. During the first time with the moneys I brought along. Since, however, I had to pay also for Hermanns' living expenses, Mr. Hilken placed further funds at my disposal." When asked how long he lived with the money the General Staff gave him, he said it was difficult to be exact as to the date, he thought " that Mr. Hilken gave me the moneys which we needed for our maintenance and expenses since the end of December or the beginning of January." (id. p. 49.) These moneys he received from Hoppenberg in New York with whom Hilken had arranged a credit for Woehst (id. p. 49). He was asked whether he could say how much money he received from Hilken through Hoppenberg and stated that it was a very difficult thing to give exact figures: " All I can say with certainty is that I got small amounts from time to time which, all in all, did by no means exceed the sum of SI,000 ". (id. p. 50.) 1 It will be recalled that, according to Woehst's cousin, Hildegarde Jacobsen, Hilken had accused Woehst of sending " blackmailing " letters, and Woehst felt that he " might suffer severe punishment in Germany ", but that " he had been able to square himself with his Government." (Supra, this opinion p. 134.) (Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 333.)</p>
<p>336</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>He used this money to pay for rent, food, wearing apparel, small tips which had to be given to the freight yard watchmen as well as pocket money for Herrmann. The amounts of money he paid the freight watchmen were small, a dollar or two at a time (id. p. 50). He also stated that Herrmann did not receive any money from Hilken while he was with him, as Hilken told Woehst expressly to pay also for Herrmann's subsistence and to give him the necessary pocket money. He claimed to have given Herrmann only $ 15 per week for pocket money (id. p. 51 ), and he recalled that at a celebration in New York and when they were together in New York at Rector's and the mezzanine restaurant in the McAlpin —proba- bly three or four times — Herrmann had very little money and Woehst had to pay for him (id. p. 51). Beyond the money given to Herrmann for pocket money, he gave him nothing except $300 or $400 with " which I sent him to Savannah for Captain Huelst ". Herrmann never had large sums of money at his disposal and he always came to see Woehst if he needed money. He met Herrmann's father once and got the impression that the finances of the family were not in good shape (id. pp. 51, 52). 1 An examination of the record shows that Woehst was guilty of deliberate falsehood in making the above claims. Hilken's check stubs (Ex. 909, Ann. B) have the following items: Check Stub Date Amount Number Notation December 1, 1916 December 5, 1916 December 13, 1916 December 21, 1916 December 28, 1916 January 13, 1917 January 23, 1917 $300.00 100.00 500.00 500.00 500.00 1.000.00 1,000.00 146 149 152 157 159 166 169 " Cash Lewis " " Lewis " " Cash Hauton " " Cash Fred. &amp; Edw. J " Lewis &amp; Haut." " W &amp; L " " a/c W &amp; L " There is no dispute that the above items totalling $3,900, were paid for sabo- tage activities with which Herrmann and Woehst were connected. Woehst claims to have paid all of the living expenses of himself and Herrmann and to have allowed Herrmann $15 a week for spending money. The balance, if Woehst be telling the truth, went to Woehst's own account. In his brief filed on the 16th day of November, 1938 (p. 32etseq.), the German Agent contended that the words " set of glasses " contained in the Ahrendt post- script meant either " $1,000 " or " sum of money ". In order to sustain this contention, the German Agent was forced perhaps unconsciously, to repudiate Woehst's claim that he never received from Hilken more than $1,000 and also the claim that he furnished Herrmann all of his money. The Ahrendt postscript was appended to a letter written by Ahrendt to Hilken dated January 19, 1917, and read as follows (see original letter filed September 13, 1938, with brief of United States): " Yours of the 18th just received and am delighted to learn that the von Hindenburg of Roland Park won another victory. " Had a note from March who is still at McAlpin. Asks me to advise his brother that he is in urgent need of another set of glasses. He would like to see his brother as soon as possible on this account." In the brief of the German Agent filed November 16, 1938, we find the following (p.35) : 1 Hilken testified that from the time he got back from Germany in April, 1916, until the United States entered the war in April, 1917, he paid Herrmann and Hinsch more than $50,000 (Ex. 583, Rec. pp. 2186-2187).</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>337 " The second paragraph of the postscript, when translated into plain language therefore has this meaning: " ' Had a note from Herrmann who is still at McAlpin. Asks me to advise you that he is in urgent need of another $1000.— (or another sum of money) he would like to see you as soon as possible on this account.' " In order to sustain this contention, the German Agent refers to Exhibit 909, stubs 166 and 169. As found in Hilken's check book, these stubs are as follows: "No. 166 Date Jan. 13, 1917 Pay to C. Hoppenberg For W&amp; L 1,000.00" "No. 169 Date Jan. 23, 1917 Pay to C. Hoppenberg For a/c W &amp; L 1,000.00" The German Agent calls attention to the fact that Herrmann and Woehst obtained from Hilken the sum of S 1,000 on January 13. 1917. and a like sum of $1,000 on January 23, 1917. and argues that the language "another set of glasses ", used in the postscript on the 19th, had reference to the prior payment on January 13th of SI.000. In making this argument the German Agent said (p. 35): " In the light of the foregoing facts, the conclusion is inescapable that Herr- mann's note to Ahrendt emphasizing his urgent need and his desire to see Hilken at the earliest convenience was an appeal for funds. The fact that Herrmann in his note to Ahrendt used veiled language is in noways surprising and only in line with the procedure observed by Salzer at Hilken's request on the above mentioned occasion, when Herrmann wanted to meet Hilken on December 11, 1916. Mani- festly Hilken was anxious to preclude from written communications any references that might link him to Herrmann and to payments made to Herrmann, f1] The expression ' another set of glasses ' is easily explained in the light of the foregoing set of facts. A very short time prior to that date (on January 13, 1917), Herrmann and Woehst obtained from Hilken the sum of S 1,000.— (U. S. Ex. 909. stub No. 1661, and apparently asked for and received on January 23, 1917 another 81,000." Here we have the German Agent admitting that Woehst had been the recipi- ent of at least 82,000 of Hilken's money within ten days time, although the German Agent had filed on August 18, 1930, German Exhibit CXXIV in which Woehst claimed that he never received from Hilken more than 81,000 out of which he paid to Herrmann SI5 a week and no more. (As to how German saboteurs were financed, see infra, this opinion, p. 151.) ' Herrmann's Testimony as to Woehst's Sabotage Activities Is Confirmed by the Hilken-Arnold Correspondence From Herrmann's confession of April. 1930, before the two Agents, we learn that he met Woehst about the beginning of December or the end of November. 1916, when he came from the General Staff to report to Hilken (Rec. p. 5451) ; and Woehst stated that his instructions from the General Staff were to report to Hilken and " Through Hilken get in touch with Captain Hinstch and I about blowing up these things " and he was " to go over there and help Hintsch and to use those tubes." (Rec. p. 5489.) 1 If Herrmann was not engaged in sabotage, why should Hilken have been anxious not to be linked with payments made to Herrmann? 2 Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 345.</p>

<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>An examination of the Hilken-Arnold correspondence confirms in detail Herr- mann's testimony regarding Woehst. On December the 12th, 1916, J. A. Arnold, who was prominent among the German saboteurs in South America and who was financed by Hilken, wrote Hilken a letter from Buenos Aires which contained the following: " I have noted that you will sign your cables by a name commencing with H. I1] and I will sign mine by a name commencing with A. I thought it was safer to sign my last cable by S's F. than by my name, because I did not want the cable office to know my being in connection with you. At the same time I wanted to be absolutely sure that you knew the cable came from me. I did not believe that the name S. was known to anybody here or there, and I am thankful to you for your warning. In the meantime you will have received my letters of Oct. 14, 18, and Nov. 16, &amp; 24. " I am sure you have been very busy all the time, as I have read so much about your work in the papers, and I congratulate you on account of your success ! My business has been pretty good here and the prospects are far from being bad. With regard to our meeting I have come to the conclusion, that it will be better for us that I go to see you. I shall have to speak to men of different branches and got my informations from specialists." (Ex. 906, Ann. GG). Under date of January 11, 1917, Hilken replied acknowledging receipt of the letter quoted above and other letters written by Arnold, and then he says: " Of course, I was greatly interested in all you wrote me regarding the progress of your business, the difficulties you have met with, etc. etc. I think your idea to come here a good one, especially as our principals abroad, realizing that my other interests require too much of my time and make it impossible for me to devote my energies to their interests, have sent a young man, who arrived here a month ago and whom I have since initiated into our American trade. He brought with him several new samples which may also find a market in Argentine. * * * * * * * " Only a few days ago I wrote my friend H. Arnold of the North German Lloyd at Buenos Aires to pay you on demand up to SI,000.— gold equal about 2000 pesos, but referring to your letter of November 24th, I have decided to remit an additional $1000.— gold for account of Mr. F. O. H. Thomae. I shall probably send this through the Guarantee Trust Co. direct to the Banco Aleman Trans- atlantico for credit to account of Mr. Thomae. This is all the money I can spare at present ; but I have written to our principals abroad requesting them for additional funds, also asking for order from them to remit additional amounts to you." (Ex. 906, Ann. HH). In his examination under subpoena, Exhibit 976, Annex E, Hilken testified that when he came back from Germany, after his meeting with Nadolny and Marguerre : " there were two men sent over, I might say three, although one arrived here a little before I did — that was Fred Herrmann ; the other two were Arnold, who was to go to South America, and whom I financed, and Willie Woehst, who arrived here in November, 1916." (id. p. 49). He further testified that Woehst came from Nadolny and Marguerre for sabotage work and was added to the sabotage forces which were working under him and reported to Hilken in Baltimore (id. p. 49). He then was shown the carbon copy of the letter of January 11, 1917, addressed to J. A. Arnold which is quoted above and testified as follows: " First of all, who are the ' principals abroad ' to whom you refer? " A. Nadolny and Marguerre. 1 For evidence of this practice by Hilken see his 1915 diary, Ex. 585, Ann. C; also Ex. 976, Ann. E, pp. 87, 88.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>339 " Q.. Who is the young man you mentioned? " A. What date is that letter? "Q.January 11, 1917. " A. That is Willie Woehst. '" Q,. What is the subtle allusion to your initiating him ' into our American trade ' ? " A. That is undoubtedly sabotage. It can refer to nothing else. " Q. What are the ' new samples ' which he is supposed to have brought with him? " A. Probably pencils, incendiary devices of some sort — I don't remember; no doubt that is what I was referring to. " Q. You say, ' These samples may also find a market in Argentine.' "A. Yes. Arnold was carrying on sabotage in the Argentine." (id. pp. 50-51.) He was asked whether Woehst was sent to speed up the sabotage activities in the latter part of 1916 and he explained the necessity for an additional key man due to the activities of Hinsch and Herrmann in connection with sabotage against all the plants which at that time were manufacturing munitions (id. p. 52). He was asked whether Hinsch was correct in his claim (Ger. Ex. CXXVIII, p. 110) that, after he, Paul Hilken, had returned from Germany, Hinsch had discontinued his sabotage activities and destroyed the balance of his supplies and in reply to this he stated as follows: " There was never any thought of Hinsch or Herrmann, and their men, quitting sabotage activities. In fact, Herrmann had brought with him the new incendiary devices, the tubes, and it was from that time onward that sabotage could be practised with greater effect. After my return from Germany, instead of quitting, the work was carried on with greater intensity." (id. pp. 53-54.) From the foregoing quotations it is perfectly clear that Hilken, Herrmann, Hinsch, and Woehst in America, and Arnold in South America, continued their sabotage activities after the U-boat enterprise started, and in this connection it is to be noted that Woehst arrived in this country on November 27, 1916 (Ex. 995, Anns. B &amp; C). He was sent here by Nadolny and Marguerre and he first appeared on Hilken's payroll as receiving $500 on December 13, 1916, almost exactly one month prior to Hilken's letter to Arnold (Ex. 909, Ann. B). (7) The Arnold Correspondence Proves Sabotage by German Agents in Neutral Countries Including United States In the Answers of Germany, it was specifically denied that there was a cam- paign for the destruction of war supplies in neutral countries (Section III); and it was further denied that the campaign of sabotage in neutral countries was extended to the United States while the United States was at peace with Ger- many (Section IV). In said Answers, the German Agent, on behalf of his government specifically denied that any order was issued by any department or agency authorizing sabotage in the United States (Par. 13 of Germany's Answers). The Answers admitted that the message of January 26, 1915, authorizing sabotage against munition factories was genuine, but claimed that it was the " blunder " of a subordinate; that at any rate it remained in the files and no action was ever taken on it (Par. 14). In German Exhibit CXXIII, affidavit of Hans Marguerre of" Sektion Po- litik ", it was admitted that, while the United States was neutral, men and material for sabotage were sent to the United States, and that Hilken and Herrmann were specifically supplied, the former with money, and the latter with incendiary devices, to be used for sabotage in the United States, but it was</p>
<p>340</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>claimed that, so long as the United States was neutral, they were only to get information as to establishments producing war material, but that they did not have orders to destroy such establishments so long as the country was neutral; but it was necessary " to make our preparations in America during neutrality so that in case of America's entering the war we would have agents and material on the other side ". (Testimony July 30, 1930, p. 15.) A somewhat similar claim was made by Hinsch, namely, although he had been engaged in sabotage ever since he saw Rintelen personally, after Hilken returned from Berlin, where he met Nadolny and Marguerre in the spring of 1916, he (Hinsch) ceased his former activities, and did not further engage in sabotage (Ger. Ex. CXXVIII, pp. 88-93, 109). The confessions of Hilken and Herrmann specifically contradicted Germany's Answers and Marguerre's affidavit. Hilken's comment in his examination under subpoena with regard to Mar- guerre's statement that sabotage was not to begin until the United States entered the war is pertinent and deserves to be quoted. He said: " Well, for obvious reasons, Mr. Sobeloff, ['] none of those instructions were in writing, but it is all bunk when he says that sabotage was not to take place until after America went into the War. And the very fact that all the men connected with sabotage left the minute America was in the war proves that. " The whole sabotage work was against munition plants while they were manu- facturing munitions for the Allies, and that was understood. It was understood between Marguerre, Nadolny, Herrmann, Dilger and myself, we all knew. Of course, it is their word against my word. * * * * * * * " Another thing that wholly disproves the contention is the fact that the entire inoculation of horses with anthrax germs was done long before I even met Nadolny and Marguerre. It was done immediately after Rintelen came over here, and Hinsch and Dilger were active in that long before I was taken ill, they were active in it and had their whole organization complete for the inoculation of horses, down at Norfolk and Newport News. Then the fact that when Rintelen came over here he established the ' cigar ' factory for making bombs at that time. It is so ridiculous on the face of it — the whole record proves that sabotage was going on during that whole period, before, not merely by us, but take the cases out on the Pacific Coast. Then there was Bode and Wolpert, the bunch that was working in Hoboken. They were all working at it. And the Consul at San Francisco, he had a gang working at that time. In fact, Fay, Rintelen &amp; von der Goltz not only planned but executed their sabotage operations and were convicted and sentenced to Atlanta on that account long in advance of the entry of the United States into the War. Fay was actually convicted before we entered the war, and, as I recall, Rintelen's conviction may have been delayed, but it was on account of activities that long antedated our entry into the War. * * * * * * * " After I came back from Germany there were two men sent over, I might say three, although one arrived here a little before I did — that was Fred Herrmann: the other two were Arnold, who was to go to South America, and whom I financed, and Willie Woehst, who arrived here in November, 1916. Now Willie Woehst came directly from Nadolny and Marguerre in 1916, in November. * * * * * * * " He [Woehst] was to be added to the sabotage forces which were working under me." (Ex. 976. Ann. E, pp. 46-49.) The correspondence between Arnold and Hilken (Ex. 906, Anns. T. et seq.) and the intercepted cables passing between Berlin and Buenos Aires specifically show the falsity of Germany's pleading, first, that Germany never authorized 1 Mr. SobelofT, the United States Attorney at Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>341 sabotage in neutral countries, and, second, that the instructions to Hilken and Herrmann were not to commit acts of sabotage in America until and unless America entered the war. This correspondence and the intercepted cables show that Arnold was a German agent equipped with disease germs and incendiary devices to be used principally in the Argentine, which never declared war against Germany; that these sabotage instruments were so used by him; that he was paid by Hilken many thousands of dollars for his sabotage work in the Argentine. But these letters and cables also conclusively show that, while Arnold was carrying on sabotage work in the Argentine, Hilken through Hinsch, Herrmann and Woehst, was conducting a program of incendiary sabotage and of inoculating animals in America; and that this program was not interrupted by the U-boat enterprise, but was coincident with that scheme, and lasted until it was interrupted by the entry of the United States in the war, at which time all the German saboteurs, except Hilken, scurried away from America, like rats deserting a sinking ship. It is clearly established that Arnold was an Agent of the Admiralty Staff, operating in the Argentine and other Latin-America countries in 1916, 1917 and 1918, and that he had been loaned to the General Staff (Ex. 320, Rec. pp. 866, 869, 900) ; and Arnold was most probably the Admiralty agent who came to the United States in 1915 with a Swiss passport under the name of Victor Thomsen (id. Rec. pp. 822, 874, 875). Arnold, like Hilken, was working for " Sektion Politik " of the General Staff, and the expressions " our friends abroad " and " our principals " found in their correspondence can only refer to the " Sektion Politik " of the General Staff. Attached to Exhibit 906, there are annexed communications passing between Hilken in Baltimore and Arnold in Havana and later in Buenos Aires, in which thinly veiled references are made to the sabotage activities of both of them. These communications began on August 3, 1916, just four days after the de- struction of Black Tom and two days after the " U-Deutschland " sailed from Bal- timore, and continued through February 24, 1917, and prove conclusively that Hilken and his agents, including Herrmann, were actively engaged in sabotage operations in the United States, the Argentine and other countries, coincident with Hilken's submarine activities; and thus discredit both Ahrendt and Hinsch, who testified that, after the submarine enterprise started, Hinsch was so busy, and was confined so closely to the submarine base, first, at Baltimore and later at New London, that it was impossible for him to engage in any other form of activity. By this correspondence it is established that Arnold had, during a part of the time, two cover addresses, to-wit, Mr. John Herbert Schmidt, Casilla de correo 487 (Ex. 906, ann. CC), an admitted agent of the General Staff (Ex. 320, Rec. p. 869) and Senor F. O. H. Thomae, Casilla de correo 692, Buenos Aires (Ex. 906, Ann. EE), and that Hilken had three cover addresses, two in Baltimore and one in Ashtabula, Ohio (Ex. 906, Ann. BB 1). When Arnold needed money and could not get it through another German agent in the Argentine, John Herbert Schmidt, he would apply to Hilken asking him to remit the money to " Mr. Thomae, who keeps my money", and he " has an account in the Banco Aleman Transatlantic, here " (Ex. 906, Ann. FF). Arnold warned Hilken that : " It would perhaps be better not to send letters in envellops of your Navigation Co., as certain people are very sharp in this country." (Ex. 906, Ann. GG.) A few quotations from the correspondence between Arnold and Hilken and from the intercepted cables will show clearly that Arnold was the agent of the General Staff for sabotage in the Argentine just as Hilken was in the United 23</p>
<p>342</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>States, and that both of these agents continued their activity until the United States entered the war. Under date of August 3,1916, Arnold in Havana wrote Hilken suggesting that Hilken meet him in Colon and that they go together to South America, saying: " * * * it is a shorter trip along the West Coast * * *. I have a few medicines with me." (Ex. 906, Ann. T.) On August 7, 1916, Hilken cabled Arnold at Havana as follows: " Have been trying arrange meeting with you Regret impossible leaving before September if you consider advisable will send trustworthy representative to meet you * * * ". (id. Ann. Y) (Emphasis supplied.) This " trustworthy representative " was Herrmann. See Paul Hilken's letter of August 6, 1916 (typographical error 1917 to) his father: " Hinsch and I had already thought over in reference to Cuba that it is at present impossible for me to get away, and we must therefore send Lewis [Herrmann] there." (Ex. 42 attached to Ex. 976, Anns. A-D.) On August 21, 1916, Hilken wrote Arnold apologizing for not being able to meet him at Havana or Panama, as had been suggested by Arnold, and saying: " Nothing would please me more, especially as I realize that you may need me there. Unfortunately, I am at present unable to say whether it will be possible for me to go to South America, especially, because our friends abroad have been urging me to see them at the earliest possible moment." (Ex. 906, Ann. B B 1.) (Emphasis supplied.) On October 14, 1916, Arnold in Buenos Aires wrote Hilken in reply to the letter of August 21, 1916, stating it was necessary for him to get out of the tropics and he has reached " this cool country after a short time (with my samples)", and then states: " * * * I have also a great interest of seeing you, as I would want to speak to you about some new articles for which there will be a good market here. " * * * I have so far executed my first order, but before you get this letter, I shall have executed many more orders, as I have booked several. There is a big market for my article — shaving brush — in this country; but with the same expenses for office, travelling, salaries and so on I may carry some more articles and make a great success. The Argentine is getting very important, indeed." (Ex. 906, Ann. CC.) (Emphasis supplied.) In Exhibit 320, Rec. p. 869, there is an intercepted message of January 24, 1917, identifying John Herbert Schmidt as " agent for the General Staff ", and instructing him " to work in cooperation with reliable agent of the Navy ". Under date of November 24, 1916, Arnold wrote Hilken indicating that things were not progressing smoothly and requesting funds, as follows: " * * * then I shall need about five thousand dollars gold ". (Ex. 906, Ann. FF.) Under date of December 12, 1916, Arnold wrote Hilken a letter, suggesting the desirability of Arnold's going north to meet Hilken, saying: " I am sure you have been very busy all the time, as I have read so much about your work in the papers, and I congratulate you on account of your success! My business has been pretty good here and the prospects are far from being bad." (Ex. 906, Ann. GG.) Under date of January 11, 1917, Hilken replied to Arnold's letter of December 12, as well as his earlier letters of October 14 and 18, and Nov. 16 and 24, saying:</p>

He brought with him several new samples which may also find a market in Argentine. * * * * * * * " Only a few days ago I wrote my friend H. Arnold of the North German Lloyd at Buenos Aires to pay you on demand up to $1,000.— gold equal about 2000 pesos, but referring to your letter of November 24th, I have decided to remit an additional S 1,000.— gold for account of Mr. F. O. H. Thomae. * * * This is all the money I can spare at present; but I have written to our principals abroad requesting them for additional funds, also asking for order froin them to remit additional amounts to you." (Ex. 906, Ann. HH.) (Emphasis supplied.) The " young man, who arrived here a month ago " and who was initiated by Hilken " into our American trade " is identified by Hilken as being Willie Woehst, who brought with him some new tubes (Ex. 976, Ann. E, pp. 49-51). Woehst arrived on the " Frederick VIII " on November 27, 1916 (Ex. 995, Ann. C). In addition to the payments to J. A. Arnold, mentioned in Hilken's letter of January 11, 1917, the record discloses that, under date of April 6, 1917, Hilken wrote Crossman &amp; Sielken asking that they remit $5,000 to Arnold in Buenos Aires (Ex. 906, Ann. QQ.), and on August 17, 1917, Hilken sent 84,000 to Arnold, as evidenced by his check No. 238 (Ex. 909). Underdate of February 13, 1917, Arnold wrote Hilken acknowledging Hil- ken's letter of January 11th, 1917, expressing his intention to leave about the 23rd instant for New York and then he says: " Many thanks for advising your friend to pay me the sum, you mention in your letter. I will call upon him one of these days, and as difficulties have arisen again, as I anticipated, I shall need the money, to keep my firm here supplied with money for about four months hence. But for the future I cannot be left without funds, and it was very good of you, to write to our friends, requesting them for additional funds." (Ex. 906, Ann. 00) Under date of January 20, 1917, Arnold, in Buenos Aires, wrote Hilken complaining about the non-cooperation he was receiving in the Argentine and expressing his opinion that: " * * * it will be most necessary to go to the States and talk over many things. I have wired for permission and I hope to get soon a telegram from you telling me that I shall leave. Business is alright, and my men are good fellows so that I may be away for some time." (Ex. 906, Ann. LL.) Under the same date, January 20, 1917, Moller, in Buenos Aires, sent a message to Berlin: " For Admiralty Staff of Navy in Berlin Arnold to General Staff Political. " Request permission by telegram to make a journey to North America for the purpose of consulting a friend there. " Affairs here will be carried on as usual during my absence." (Ex. 320, Rec. p. 869.) That Arnold made his trip north and saw Hilken is evidenced by information contained in a letter dated July 6, 1917, from Arnold under the name of Thomp- sen quoted in a message dated July (?), 1917 from Madrid to Berlin, reading as follows : " I have received a letter from B'aires dated July 6. " The following is to be forwarded to the General Staff:</p>

" I have received * * * for Department ' E ' and ' B ' from here in September and January each 10,000 paper pesos, from Paul in February 1,000 and in May 5,000 gold dollars; Funds will last until October 5th. Please remit before that date 2,000 pesos. The results from this department appear to be very satis- factory. " Dynamo Department has drawn the Neiling credit of 100,000 marks. Thomp- sen." (Ex. 320, Rec. pp. 874-875.) The above message is confirmed by another message of the same tenor sent July 23, 1917, reading as follows: " From: B. A. To. Berlin " For General Staff No. 3 " Have spoken with Paul and learn that meeting of Dynamometer and other machine experts was impossible. Declaration of war made hurried return necessary. " Have received at B'aires 20,000 pesos. Paul 5,000 dois. Funds will be ex- hausted by October. Request further 20,000 pesos. " Dynamo section has drawn out the Neiling credit of 10,000 marks. (signed) Thompson." (Ex. 320, Rec. p. 875.) The fact that Arnold met Hilken in New York is evidenced by an entry in Hilken's diary for 1917 for Wednesday, March 28th, reading as follows: " X to N. Y. Il a. m. breakfast diner See Arnold dine Biltmore Rice Fr. and Arnold — Reisenweber's X " (Ex. 583, Ann. D; Rec. p. 2329.) It is clearly established by contemporaneous intercepted messages that Arnold's sabotage activities in the Argentine continued throughout the year</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-1917"><span class="para-num">1917.</span><p>Some of these messages are set out below: Under date of July 9, 1917, Luxburg, German Minister to the Argentine, radioed Germany as follows: " Without showing any tendency to make concessions, postpone reply to Argen- tine * * * note until receipt of further reports. A change of Ministry is probable. " As regards Argentine steamers, I recommend either compelling them to turn back, sinking them without leaving any traces or letting them through. They are all quite small." (Ex. 868, Ann. N.) (Emphasis supplied.) Under date of December 14, 1917, Madrid cabled Berlin as follows: " Arnold desires express instructions as to whether he should stop using dyna- mite against outgoing ships. He reports the departure of a new mule transport on November 30th for Mesopotamia." (Ex. 320, Rec. p. 882.) Under date of December 18, 1917, Berlin sent the following in reply to the Arnold inquiry reported in the cable of December 14, 1917 (Ex. 320, Rec. p. 882), from Madrid to Berlin. This message reads as follows: " Military No. 21656 For the Military Attaché With ref. to Tel. 4592 Dec. 11th. Please communicate the following to ' A ' : — " Irritation in the political world must be avoided. The use of dynamite in vessels engaged in the coasting trade is forbidden but it is permitted * * * in the case of long voyages if its effect is delayed for a considerable period, so that it may be impossible to recognize its origin. Spare neutral and Russian vessels. " General Staff" (Ex. 320, Rec. p. 883.)</p></div>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>345 Luxburg's recommendation that Argentine steamers might be sunk " without a trace ", and the instructions from Berlin to the Military Attaché to be com- municated to Arnold, namely, " Dynamite in vessels is permitted in case of long voyages, if its effect is delayed for a considerable period, so that it may be im- possible to recognize its origin " would seem to indicate that the only immoral thing connected with sabotage in neutral countries is the sin of getting caught. Compare the instruction given to von Eckardt, the German Minister to Mexico, in connection with the proposed destruction of the Tampico Oil Fields by Herrmann : Herrmann is correct. He has a commission to set fire to the Tampico oil Felds but don't openly support him. (8) Financing the Saboteurs In German Exhibit CXXIII, filed August 15, 1930, Marguerre described his task in " Sektion Politik ", first, in belligerent countries and, second, in neutral countries (id. Testimony July 30, 1930, pp. 4-7). He next described the activi- ties of his agents in America and states that he provided them with instructions and material to stop the working of American establishments essential for war, but that " these instructions were to be followed out only in the event that America should enter the war and were to take effect only from that date on " (id. p. 8). He related the incident when Captain Nadolny came to his office with Hilken, Jr., and Herrmann and a third gentleman. In a prior conference Nadolny had informed Marguerre that some gentlemen from America were in Berlin ; among them was a Germ an-American who had been selected as the head of the sub- marine boat service and he also spoke of Hilken as one who " could assist us in the agents-service and that we could use his services in trans- mitting money and news." (Id. pp. 9, 10.) At the interview which was held in the afternoon (of Tuesday, February 18, 1916) Nadolny made the introductions but " very soon left my room " and Marguerre stated that: " I still have a picture in my mind of that discussion. Mr. Nadolny left the room very soon and was not present when I spoke to Hermann about the work assigned to him. I still picture Mr. Nadolny taking leave from us with a short bow before I proceeded to converse with Hermann." (Id. pp. 10, 11.) He then testified as follows: " Yes. As I said before, said discussion is still in my mind. I first spoke to Mr. Hilken about the question of transmitting money to our agents in America, since Captain Nadolny had told me at our conference in the forenoon that Mr. Hilken could assist us in paying out money to the agents. As far as I remember, I told him that it was to be his task to pay out money placed at his disposal by us to agents named to him by us. This was the only question we talked about since Mr. Hilken was to be employed only as intermediary for paying over money to our agents." (Id. p. 11.) (Emphasis supplied.) He claimed, however, that, outside of the payment of money to the agents, he did " not recall having discussed with him matters of our intelligence service " (id. pp. 11,12). He also claimed that he was careful to take Herrmann aside and that he kept his back to Hilken and the other gentlemen, while he was giving Herrmann his instructions and describing to him the incendiary pencils (id. p. 12 et seq.); and he claimed that Hilken did not take part in the expla- nation of the incendiary pencils which he was careful to give to Herrmann; and</p>
<p>346</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>that, while he was doing this, he turned his back on Hilken, but it was easily possible that Hilken saw the pencils or that Herrmann showed them to him towards the end of the conference (id. p. 17). Hilken, in describing the same meeting, said that Nadolny and Marguerre told him that he was to pay money to Herrmann whenever Herrmann needed it in America ; and he said that the money which he paid to Herrmann was from funds made available to him by the General Staff (Ex. 583. Rec. pp. 2180, 2183, 2185). He further testified that he had credits in the Continental Bank, the Corn Exchange Bank, the Baltimore Trust Company, and the Guaranty Trust Com- pany on which he drew for the purpose of these payments (id. p. 2185) ; and that from the time he got back from Germany in about April, 1916, until the time the United States entered the war in 1917, he paid Herrmann and Hinsch more than $50,000 (id. p. 2186). The funds were made available to him probably within two or three months after he got back and were either kept in a special bank account, or he cashed them immediately, and kept them in a safe deposit box, where he always kept a lot of money, some in 81,000 bills, some $500's and some $100's (id. Rec. pp. 2187-2188). The moneys he sent to Mexico after April, 1917, for Hinsch. Dilger and Herrmann may have been over $100,000, and he gave Hinsch the sum of $23,361.75 which Hinsch took with him to Mexico in the latter part of May, 1917 (id. pp. 2189, 2209, 2252). On May 24th, 1917, Hilken paid Hinsch SI.500 (Ex. 976, Ann. E, p. 128; also check No. 218, dated May 24. 1917. for $1,500, Ex. 909, Ann. C). In his deposition of August 26, 1930, Hilken testified that according to his recollection he paid Hinsch and Herrmann 860,000 not including the funds he had previously received from Rintelen, and that, in addition, he had remitted $50,000 " to an agent in Japan " (Ex. 829, Rec. pp. 6110, 6111). He had previously testified that he had received in the neighborhood of S10.000 from Rintelen and expended the same for sabotage purposes which he paid to Hinsch, mostly in S 1,000 bills, and that Hinsch did not account to him for what use he made of these moneys (id. pp. 6099, 6100). In his testimony under subpoena in September, 1933, Hilken explained the '" A. C. D." account on the books of the Eastern Forwarding Company, aggre- gating $95.000, as representing the amounts credited on his books on which Anton Dilger drew after he got to Mexico (Ex. 976, Ann. E, pp. 44-46). He further testified that he did not remember the exact amounts he sent to Mexico. " but it was probably in the neighborhood of two or three hundred thousand [dollars] that eventually went to Mexico * * * to get them [the saboteurs] out of this country, and also to finance Herrmann. Dilger and Hinsch who had then gone to Mexico." (Id. pp. 45, 46.) Some of this money went before and some after the United States had entered the war (id. p. 46). We have already seen that after Hermann left the United States and went to Mexico, von Eckardt, the German Minister, on the 13th day of April. 1917. forwarded a telegram of Herrmann's " to Marguerre or Nadolny " of the General Staff reading as follows: " Where is Lieut. Wohst stationed? Has he sent about 25,000 dollars to Paul Hilken. He or somebody else it so [is to?] send me money." (Ex. 520, Rec. p. 1847.) This is a clear indication that Hilken was expecting to receive an additional sum of $25.000 for sabotage purposes in Mexico.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>347 That large sums of money were being made available by the General Staff to Hilken for sabotage purposes is conclusively established by the following cables from the General Staff, Berlin: (1) Dated December 6, 1917, from Berlin to Madrid reading as follows: " Financial assistance through the Argentine is impossible in view of the present political situation and the lack of communication. When 5300,000 have been transmitted to the Minister by HILKEN, fresh funds for espionage are unnecessary. (Signed) General Staff " (Ex. 868, Ann. O) (2) Dated December 18, 1917, from Berlin to Madrid: " Please ask Delmar [Dilger] whether the remittance of 300,000 by Hilken to the Minister at Mexico has taken place." (Ex. 868, Ann. P.) In February, 1932, Hilken located his check stubs on his sabotage account in the Corn Exchange Bank in New York. From this account alone, he paid, during the period August, 1916, to August, 1917, to the German saboteurs — Herrmann, Hinsch, Woehst, Arnold, and Gerdts — the sum of 526,209.65 (Ex. 909). This was in addition to the sums of 523,361.75 and $1,500, given to Hinsch at the time Hinsch left for Mexico in the latter part of May. 1917. Therefore, during the twelve month period aforesaid, Hilken paid from his account in the Corn Exchange Bank the sum of $51,071.40. All of these pay- ments are evidenced by undisputed, contemporaneous, documentary evidence, and prove conclusively that the German Government during that period ex- pended, from one account, nearly SI,000 a week in financing the sabotage operations of Hilken and his group. (5) Summary and Conclusion on the Question of Fraud We have examined the pleadings and ascertained from the evidence, adduced to sustain the pleadings, that the pleadings filed by Germany were false in making the following allegations: (1) Germany had never authorized sabotage in neutral countries; (2) Sabotage in the United States had never been authorized during the period of its neutrality; (3) Though men and material for sabotage were sent to the United States in 1916, definite instructions were given limiting and prohibiting the sabotage activity until the time when the United States should enter the war. We have examined the evidence and shown that Germany authorized, and German agents committed, acts of sabotage in neutral countries, some of which remained neutral throughout the war; that Germany authorized, and German agents committed, acts of sabotage in the United States while the United States was neutral; and that Germany authorized, and German agents committed, acts of sabotage in Mexico and Argentine, both of which countries remained neutral during the war. We have examined the evidence adduced by Germany and have ascertained that Wozniak, at whose bench the Kingsland fire started, was guilty of perjury and fraud permeating and destroying the whole of his testimony. We have shown that his testimony, in essential features, was false, and that it was purchased and paid for before his affidavits were filed; that, before his affidavits were filed, he demanded and received large sums of money, and that his demands for compensation began before his affidavits were filed and that they had not ceased when Germany repudiated him as a witness. We have shown that he wrote two letters to the Russians warning them of what he claimed to be deplora- ble conditions in the Kingsland factory, and that, two days before the fire, he wrote a postal card warning that a catastrophe was impending, but that he made</p>
<p>348</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>no disclosures of his information or fears, either to the authorities at the plant or to the police. We have further shown that, after he was repudiated as a witness by Germany, he contradicted all the important points of his former testimony. We have shown that the Lyndhurst testimony, upon which the Commission based its decision at Hamburg with regard to the Kingsland fire, was false and purchased and known to have been false before the affidavits were filed by Germany, and that the three witnesses producing the same were promised additional compensation when the case should be closed. It has been clearly established that Ahrendt, Woehst, and Hinsch, the three witnesses introduced by Germany to disprove the confessions of Herrmann and Hilken, were guilty of the grossest kind of fraud; and, although they claimed to be innocent and ignorant of any sabotage in the United States during neutrality, they were part and parcel of the band of saboteurs whose activities were responsi- ble for the loss of millions of dollars worth of property and many lives. After the record had clearly established the fact that Hinsch, under employ- ment by Rintelen and Hilken, had been engaged in acts of incendiary sabotage and inoculating animals with disease, it was claimed by Germany that this form of sabotage ceased, after the return of Hilken and Herrmann from the conference with Nadolny and Marguerre in Berlin in February, 1916. On the contrary, it has been clearly established that, as a result of that con- ference, Herrmann was sent to America, " with new devices ", and that Herr- mann and Hinsch both continued the same forms of sabotage; that Hilken continued as sabotage paymaster, and that Ahrendt and Woehst aided and abetted them in their destructive mission. We have shown that Hinsch, upon whose testimony Germany mainly relied to break down the confessions of Herrmann and of Hilken, as well as to destroy the Herrmann message, began his sabotage activities with Rintelen and contin- ued them in the United States until he was forced to flee from this country to escape a Presidential warrant of arrest, and that, after he got to Mexico, his sabotage activities did not cease. In order to substantiate Germany's false plead- ings, he made many false statements upon which the Commission relied in its several opinions. In the course of the examination of the testimony given by Germany's wit- nesses, it has become more and more evident that their affidavits, which were carefully prepared to destroy the confessions of Hilken and Herrmann, have been built upon a mass of false pleadings and false premises. The destruction of these false pleadings and false premises has left the confessions of Hilken and Herrmann without the stigma produced by these false attacks, and these confessions must be reexamined in the light of the destruction of the perjured evidence directed against them. The conclusion from an exhaustive examination of the record, is accordingly irresistible that the decision of October 16, 1930, reached at Hamburg, must be set aside, revoked and annulled; and the cases reinstated in the position they were before that decision was rendered. Wozniak, the man at whose bench the Kingsland fire started, has admitted, since the Hamburg decision, that he consorted with German agents; that they instructed him in the methods of starting a fire; and that he received money from them. We have concluded that Wozniak's failure to bring to the proper local authorities the information and fear disclosed in his letters and his postal card to the Russian authorities, coupled with his conduct at and since the fire, convict him of the complicity in the design and result. Having found from an examination of the record, both before and after the Hamburg decision, that the Kingsland fire and explosion was the work of Ger-</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>349 man agents, it now becomes necessary to examine the question as to whether German agents were responsible for the destruction of Black Tom. This question, as in the case of the Kingsland destruction, must be reexamined in the light of all of the evidence including that tendered on the issue of fraud and collusion.</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">III. HERRMANN MESSAGE</h3>
<p>What It Proves, If Genuine In the decision at Washington, December 3, 1932, the Umpire, after examining the evidence relating to the Kingsland fire, expressed his con- clusion as follows: " I am of opinion the matters above discussed are insufficient, when taken with the proofs offered before the final hearing, to alter the finding that there is no credible evidence that Wozniak was a German agent, was connected and con- sorted with German agents, or that he was in Mexico in 1917." (Decs, and Ops., p. 1013) m After expressing the above opinion, the Umpire then concluded his discussion of the Kingsland case as follows : " If the so-called Herrmann message is authentic, that document alone would compel a finding contrary to that I have just stated so far as concerns Wozniak's being a German Agent." (Id. pp. 1013, 1014.) n Later, in the same opinion in opening his discussion of the Herrmann message, the Umpire said: " On July 1, 1931, there was filed with the Commission a Blue Book magazine of the January, 1917, issue, containing upon four printed pages lines of writing running crosswise of the print. This, we are told, is a code message forwarded by Fred Herrmann in Mexico to Paul Hilken in Baltimore in April, 1917; names being referred to by numbers in the script, the numbers referring to other pages of the magazine where the names were indicated by pin pricks through printed letters in the text. The writing fluid is said to be lemon-juice made visible by the application of heat." (Id. pp. 1015, 1016.) ° The coded and decoded form of the message follows : " Have seen 1755 [Eckhardt] he is suspicious of me Can't convince him I come from 1915 [Marguerre] and 1794 [Nadolny] Have told him all reference 2584 [Hinsch] and I 2384 [Deutschland], 7595 [Jersey City Terminal], 3106 [Kings- land], 4526 [Savannah], and 8545 [Tonys Lab] he doubts me on account of my bum 7346 [German] Confirm to him thru your channels all OK and my mission here I have no funds 1755 [Eckhardt] claims he is short of money send by bearer U S 25000. — Have you heard from Willie Have wired 2336 [Hildegarde] but no answer Be careful of her and connections Where are 2584 [Hinsch] and 9107 [Carl Ahrendt] Tell 2584 [Hinsch] to come here I expect to go north but he can locate me thru 1755 [Eckhardt] I dont trust 9107 [Carl Ahrendt], 3994 [Kristoff], 1585 [Wolfgang] and that 4776 [Hoboken] bunch If cornered they might get us in Dutch with authorities See that 2584 [Hinsch] brings with him all who might implicate us. tell him 7386 [Siegel] is with me.

Most important send funds Bearer will relate experiences and details Greetings " (Ex. 904). In his further discussion of the message, the Umpire after quoting the decoded form, said: " A glance through this translation will indicate that, without reference to any- other evidence, it is conclusive proof to any reasonable man that (a) Herrmann and Hilken knew the Kingsland fire and the Black Tom explosion were the work of German agents and (b) that Hinsch, Hilken, and Herrmann, undoubted agents, were privy thereto, and (in the light of the record before the Commission) (c) that KristofTand Wozniak were active participants in these events. As the Ameri- can Agent has well said, I may utterly disregard all the new evidence produced and still, if I deem this message genuine, hold Germany responsible in both of the cases." (Decs, and Ops., p. 1016.) p The German Commissioner concurred in the whole opinion of the Umpire and therefore approved the above deductions. In a note appended to his separate opinion, the Honorable Chandler P. Ander- son, the American Commissioner, used the following language (Decs, and Ops., p. 1035) :Q " The so-called Herrmann secret message, embodied in the Blue Book Magazine for January, 1917 (Exhibit No. 904), if accepted as authentic, would conclusively prove the liability of Germany in both the Kingsland and the Black Tom cases." In this opinion we have already concluded that so far as the Kingsland disaster is concerned: " Wozniak's failure to bring to the proper local authorities the information and fears disclosed in his letters and postal card to the Russian Embassy at Wash- ington, coupled with his conduct at and since the fire, convict him of complicity in the design and result." {Supra, this Opinion, p. 53.) r This conclusion has been reached independently of the Herrmann message. It becomes necessary, therefore, to determine whether the explosion at Black Tom was the result of the activities of German agents. If the Herrmann message be a genuine document, then, under the Umpire's decision of December 3, 1932, concurred in by the German Commissioner, and under the note of the American Commissioner appended to his separate opinion, that document is conclusive proof that German agents were privy to, and active participants in, both the Kingsland and the Black Tom explosions. In the study of the question as to whether the Herrmann message is a genuine instrument, this question must, in accordance with the decision of July 29, 1935, be '" reexamined in the light of all of the evidence, including that tendered ou the issue of fraud and collusion". Before examining the record with reference to the evidence bearing on the question as to whether the Herrmann message is a genuine instrument or not. it is necessary to study the circumstances connected with the drafting, trans- mission, receipt, and production of the message. There are four persons whose testimony must be studiedi n order to get a clear picture of these circumstances, namely: Herrmann, who composed the message: P Note by the Secretarial, this volume, p. 115. q Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 126. r Note by the Seaetanat. this volume, p. 276.</p>

<p>351 Siegel, who after Herrmann had composed it, dictated the message to Herr- mann for transcription in invisible ink; Gerdts, the messenger who transported the message from Herrmann in Mexico City to Hilken in Baltimore; and Hilken, who received and developed the message in Baltimore and later produced the Blue Book message now in evidence.</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-1"><span class="para-num">1.</span><p>Herrmann Frederick L. Herrmann was born in Brooklyn, N. Y., September 10, 1895. His father was a German, born in Bederkesa, Germany, and came to this country when he was fourteen or fifteen years of age. The father was naturalized some time between 1885 and 1890 (Rec. pp. 4337. 5432). The mother was a natural born American of German descent (Rec. p. 5474). Herrmann was the second of four sons (Rec. p. 5433). When the war broke out in 1914, Herrmann was working for W. R. Grace &amp; Co.. importers and exporters, but at the beginning of the war he was laid off with a number of other employees (Rec. p. 5432). On or about January 14, 1915, a passport was issued to Herrmann in the name of Fred L. Herrmann to travel in Holland and Germany for the purpose of visiting his grandmother at Bederkesa, Germany (Rec. p. 2304). On or about February 2. 1915, Herrmann sailed from New York on the Dutch steamer " Ryndam ". Going over on this ship he met William Kott- kamp, a member of the German Secret Service and Kottkamp interested him in his activities (Rec. pp. 5425, 5433 et seq., 5475). After Herrmann had arrived at his grandmother's home in Bederkesa, he received a wire from Kottkamp calling him to Berlin where Kottkamp intro- duced him to Captain Prieger of the German Admiralty Staff (Rec. pp. 5434, 5435). Herrmann accepted service with the German Admiralty Staff and was sent to England to watch the British fleet and report its movements for Military and Naval Intelligence (Rec. p. 5435). In order to enter England, he obtained on or about March 4, 1915, an emergency passport from the American Legation at The Hague for the purpose of" visiting England for commercial business, and not to use Department pass- port which has been used in visiting Germany " (Rec. p. 5666). In a letter to the Department of State, dated June 16, 1915, relating to his application of June 10, 1915, for another passport, he claimed to have been previously employed by " The European Textile Company " which had discon- tinued business (Rec. p. 5670.) (Fred Herrmann's brother Edwin Herrmann, afterwards claimed that the name " European Textile Company " was a blind for importing incendiary devices into the United States (Ex. 729, Rec. p. 4869) ). On his first trip to England, Herrmann remained for two or three months doing espionage work and returned to Berlin via Holland, reporting to Captain Prieger of the Admiralty Staff. He then came back to this country and on or about July 1, 1915. received a new passport for the purpose of visiting Holland on " commercial business " (Rec. pp. 2309, 5437). This passport was issued upon an application dated June 10, 1915 (Ex. 583, Ann. B., p. 2308). With this passport Herrmann again entered England and matriculated at Edinburgh University in August or September, 1915, taking a course in forestry. While at Edinburgh he reported the movements of ships in the Firth of Forth where he was near the naval base. He remained at Edinburgh University until December, 1915, but his activities came under the suspicion of Scotland Yard and they put him aboard the " New Amsterdam " of the Holland Line for New York (Rec. pp. 5439. 5440).</p></div>

<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>In New York he stayed " a week or two " and then went back to Bergen in Norway, on the S. S. " Kristianafiord ". On this vessel he met Dr. Anton Dilger, alias, Delmar. After arriving in Bergen, Herrmann and Dilger went to Copen- hagen where they met members of the German Admiralty Staff. They then went to Berlin, arriving in January, 1916, where Herrmann reported his arrival to Captain Prieger (Rec. pp. 5440-5442). In Berlin Herrmann met Paul Hilken, of Baltimore, who had already been paymaster under Rintelen for German saboteurs in America and who was to become Herrmann's paymaster for the time of his employment in America. When we were discussing the subject " Financing the Saboteurs " [Supra, this Opinion,pp. 151, et seq.) ,s we ascertained that Nadolny and Marguerre arranged for a conference in " Sektion Politik " which was attended by Hilken, Herrmann and a third gentleman who turned out to be Anton Dilger (Ger. Ex. CXXIII, pp. 9 et seq. Trans, of July 30, 1930). At this conference instructions were given relating to sabotage in America, and Herrmann was furnished with sabo- tage devices for that purpose, though it was claimed by Marguerre that " these instructions " to Herrmann " were to be followed out only in the event of America entering the war and they were to take effect only from that date on " (id. p. 8). At this conference Marguerre instructed Hilken that " it was to be his task to pay out money at his disposal by us to agents named to him by us " (id. p. 11). Although Marguerre claimed that his instructions and the incendiary pencils to Herrmann were given while the others were not looking or within hearing, these facts were denied both by Hilken and Herrmann, who also denied that their instructions limited the sabotage activities until and unless America entered the war. In describing the same meeting, Hilken said that Nadolny and Marguerre told him he was to pay money to Herrmann whenever Herrmann needed it in America, and he said that the money which he paid to Herrmann was from funds made available to him by the General Staff (Ex. 583, pp. 2180-2183, 2185); and that he had credits in the Continental Bank, the Corn Exchange Bank, Baltimore Trust Company, and the Guaranty Trust Company on which he drew for the purpose of these sabotage payments. At this celebrated conference, as admitted by Marguerre, arrangements were made " that Herrmann should draw necessary funds from Hilken. Hilken was instructed to pay the funds demanded by Herrmann up to certain limit (I don't remember the amount) without requesting an accounting " (Ger. Ex. CXXIII, p. 13, Trans. 7/30-30, p. 10, Trans. 8/1-30; also Ex. 583, Rec. p. 2183). Shortly after this conference, Herrmann and Hilken returned to America on different steamers. Anton Dilger remained in Germany and did not return to the United States until July 4, 1917. On his arrival in New York, Herrmann went to Baltimore where he got in touch with Hilken early in April, 1916. Hilken introduced him to Hinsch and the sabotage activities of Herrmann in this country began at that time. How active Herrmann became in sabotage work may be realized by ascer- taining Herrmann's aliases: Anderson (p. 4340) Marstrom (p. 5522) Herman Hasrstrom (p. 2421) Lewis (p. 2244) Fred Herrmann (p. 2228) F.

It had the same officers as the partners in Schumacher and Company, which was the company representing the North German Lloyd in Baltimore. It was formed for the purpose of taking care of the American end of the shipping business in connection with the operation of commercial sub- marines between Germany and this country. While it has always been claimed by Hinsch that the operations of this company were distinct from sabotage, it is also true that with Paul Hilken, the Vice-President, and Hinsch, the General Manager, it was impossible to disassociate their activities as sabotage agents from their activities in connection with the company. The submarine " Deutschland " arrived in Baltimore early in July, 1916. She was unloaded and loaded for her return voyage the latter part of July, 1916. Hinsch and Herrmann assisted in the work of the preparation for the reception and departure of the " Deutschland " on her voyage from Germany, but Hinsch, as we have seen, was away from Baltimore on several occasions during this period. On the morning ofjuly 30, 1916, the Black Tom explosion occurred. Shortly after that time, as has been clearly established, Hinsch received $2,000 from Hilken which Hilken claims was remuneration for the Black Tom explosion and Hilken says that: " Hinsch told me at that time that he had hired the men that set fire to Black Tom." (Rec. p. 6112; also pp. 2198, 2199; Ex. 976, Ann. E, pp. 66-71.) Six days after the explosion, to-wit, on August 5th, Hinsch, Herrmann, Hop- penberg, and Hilken were in the office of the Eastern Forwarding Company in the Whitehall Building with windows looking out over the Hudson River. Two or three windows were cracked by the Black Tom explosion, and, at this meet- ing, Hoppenberg facetiously pointed to the broken windows and said: " Why, you fellows have broken my windows ". Herrmann retorted to Hoppenberg by singing a little song of the war of 1870: " Lieber Moltke, sei nicht dumm Mach mal wieder bumm bumm bumm." which being freely translated means : " Dear Moltke, Don't be so dumb, But go out rather and make bumm, bumm, bumm [explosions]." (Ex. 976, Ann. E. p. 59.) It has also been clearly shown in this opinion that Ahrendt, — though he claimed to have been innocent and ignorant of all sabotage by German agents,— one week after the fire at Kingsland, to-wit, January 19, 1917, wrote a postscript to a business letter addressed to Hilken in which he congratulated the " von Hindenberg of Roland Park " on " another victory " and informed him that Herrmann, " who is still at McAlpin ", asked Ahrendt " to advise his brother " that he was " in urgent need of another set of glasses " (incendiary tubes) (underscoring in original). ~~^™' We have also seen that Herrmann was active in assisting Carl Dilger in oper- ating germ laboratories, started by Anton Dilger, for the culture of germs to be used in inoculating animals intended for the Allies and that one of these</p>
<p>354</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>laboratories was located in Chevy Chase, D. C. During this time Herrmann lived for a while in Chevy Chase with Carl Dilger and his sister, and he, with Ahrendt, used to distribute to Hinsch and his crowd devices for inoculating animals. The Kingsland fire and explosion occured on January 11, 1917. Herrmann in his confession made in 1930 admitted that he, in cooperation with Hinsch, engineered this explosion, that he furnished two men, Wozniak and Rodriguez, who were immediately responsible therefor, with incendiary devices with which to start the fire, that he made them small weekly payments and promised to pay each man $500 in the event they were successful and that he did pay Rodriguez $500 two or three days following the explosion. He did not pay Wozniak for the reason that Wozniak failed to show up at the appointed rendezvous. We have also studied Herrmann's connection with Willie Woehst, another sabotage agent, who left this country on February 14, 1917, sailing on the same boat with Germany's diplomatic and consular representatives on their return to Germany. Herrmann on February 24, 1917, under the name of Fred Larssen, together with a Colombian national named Raoul Gerdts Pochet, sailed from New York for Havana, Cuba, on the S. S. " Pastores " en route to Mexico City. They spent about a month in Havana, where they were under the surveillance of the Department of Justice Agents. Late in March or early in April Herrmann and Gerdts sailed from Havana to Vera Cruz. On the steamer they met Siegel (Ex. 908). From Vera Cruz they went to Mexico City where they met Major Schwierz of the Mexican Army at whose advice they went to Hotel Juarez belonging to Otto Paglasch (Ex. 908). The next day after their arrival, Herrmann and Gerdts went to see von Eckardt, the German Minister, and Herrmann apprised the Minister of his connections with Nadolny and Marguerre. his activities in the United States, and of the fact that he had been authorized by " Sektion Politik "to destroy the Tampico oil fields. We have had occasion to discuss this matter before, and it will be recalled that the Minister was suspicious of Herrmann, but forwarded a wire, sent by Herrmann to the General Staff, inquiring about the whereabouts of Willie Woehst and informing the General Staff that Woehst was to send him $25,000. The General Staff confirmed Herrmann's claim that he had been authorized a year before that to set fire to the Tampico oil fields, a commission which had been renewed by Hilken in January. The Minister indicated that a member of his Staff believed that Herrmann and Gerdts were English or American spies and requested an immediate answer (Rec. pp. 1847-1848). It will be recalled that the " Sektion Politik " confirmed Herrmann's state- ments as correct, stated that they knew nothing about Gerdts, but that Woehst had been retired. " Sektion Politik " left to the Minister the decision as to whether the Tampico oil fields should be destroyed and cautioned the Minister to do nothing which would endanger Germany's relations with Mexico " or if the question arises, give Herrmann any open support " (Ex. 320, Rec. p. 874). As Herrmann received no answer to his telegram and could not get the $25,000 as a result of his cables to Hildegarde Jacobsen, Herrmann and Siegel " decided to send Raoul Pochet [Gerdts] to Baltimore to obtain funds " (Ex. 908, Ann. C). In Ex. 904(4), Herrmann identified the original Blue Book Magazine for January, 1917, in which the message was written, as being the magazine which he sent to Hilken by Raoul Gerdts in April, 1917, shortly after America came into the war. He recognized the message as being in his handwriting and stated that he told Gerdts to call upon Hoppenberg in New York to find out from him</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>355 the whereabouts of Hilken. He also said that, as he remembered the circum- stances, Gerdts returned to Mexico with only about $800.00 and told Herrmann that Hinsch was bringing down the balance of $25,000 which he requested. Herrmann is confirmed by Siegel's first statement, as follows: " Raoul Pochet [Gerdts] returned from the U.S.A. about the middle of May, but brought with him much less money than Herrmann expected, or had asked for. He reported that Captain Hinsch would shortly thereafter come himself and bring along the needed funds." (Ex. 908, Ann. C.) In Siegel's second statement, designed to raise some question as to the first statement, he still recalled that Gerdts was sent to the United States to procure money, and " Furthermore, I still know that Gerdts stayed away a long time and, to Herr- mann's disappointment, then brought with him only a comparatively small amount " (Ger. Ann. 69). In Herrmann's examination of April 3, 1930, after telling of taking Gerdts with him to Havana and from there to Mexico City, he said: " Yes; he went with me to Mexico City, and he was there I imagine about a month or five weeks or something like that. I sent him up to Paul Hilken with a couple of letters. " Q.. What were these letters about? A. Asking about Captain Hinsch, asking if any new instructions had come, and so forth." (Rec. p. 5461.) In Exhibit 986, Ann. A, p. 139, being examination under subpoena in October, 1933, Herrmann, referring to his telegram forwarded by Eckardt to Berlin, said: " I didn't believe that Von Eckhardt had cabled Berlin. So I sent Raoul Gerdts up to the States. I conferred with Siegel and we thought we better send Raoul Gerdts up to Paul. " Q.. Why? " A. To get money, to see that Hinsch and different ones got out of there. " Q.- Why did you want Hinsch and the others to get out? " A. Because I was afraid he would get caught up there. We needed funds." In the same examination Herrmann's testimony of April 3rd, 1930, quoted above was read to him and he was asked whether it was true or not. He replied: " A. I knew at that time that I had sent Raoul up with a message. Exactly what it was I did not remember until I saw the Blue Book Magazine when it was produced by Paul Hilken. " Q.. In your April, 1930 testimony, you spoke of a couple of letters being sent to Hilken. " A. That is all I remembered of it. " Q,. In January, 1929, more than a year before you testified, Gerdts testified you had sent him up with a couple of messages written in a book, and in lemon juice. Were you not aware of that when you testified in 1930? " A. I never saw any testimony of Gerdts. " Q,. So that you did not have Gerdts' testimony to refresh youi recollection in 1930? " A. No, sir. I did not see the testimony of Gerdts until — after the hearing I returned to Chile, brought my wife and children up and got settled — it must have been at least the month of July, 1930, the first time I ever saw or heard anything about Gerdts' testimony, or later even, for that matter. That is the first time I knew of it. " Q,- Didn't you remember what you had written in the message? " A. No, sir, I did not, * * * " (Ex. 986, Ann. A, pp. 140, 141). He was shown the original Exhibit 904 and he stated as follows:</p>
<p>356</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>" That is the book and the message which I sent with Raoul Gerdts to Paul Hilken, from Mexico. " Q. Does that contain one message or two messages? " A. Well, I notice the back page is missing; the last page of the last story, page 719, that is missing. Perhaps I wrote something on that. What I wrote on it I don't know. " Q,. Might it have been some code to the other message which begins on page 700? " A. It might have been. I don't exactly remember. * * * " Q,. This does contain a code, does it not? " A. Yes. The message is partly in code. The numbers in there refer to pin- pricks on the pages. "Q,. You mean the numbers refer to other pages in the magazine? "A. Yes, containing pin-pricks. " Q_. Containing pin-pricks which prick out the letters of the names referred to in the message? " A. Yes. " Q_. Referred to in the code number? " A. Yes, sir. " Q,. This message, on page 700, says, ' Have seen 1755. He is suspicious of me.' How would Hilken know, first of all, on what page of the magazine the message was, and then, having discovered on what page it was, and having heated that page, how would he find out where to look for the pin-pricks that spelled out the name of the person intended by 1755? "A. I don't remember how he was to find the pages containing the message, nor how I indicated to him the code which I had used. Possibly the missing last page is the missing link. "Q,. Had you arranged such a code with Hilken before your departure from the United States? "A. That I don't remember. "Q.. Did you ever use a code like this in which a number was interpreted by referring to the pin-pricks on another page of the book? "A. It is quite possible. " Q . Do you recall sending the message in the magazine? "A. I certainly do. "Q_. Do you recall where you got the magazine? "A. No, I don't recall where I got the magazine; I might have bought it in Havana, perhaps I bought it in Mexico City, at one of the book stores there. I don't remember where I bought it." (id. pp. 141, 142, 143, 144) In Exhibit 583, Annexes P, Q_ and R, Special Agent Berliner made to the Department of Justice reports, dated repectively March 1st, 2nd and 11th, 1917, -on Raul Pichot (Pochet, Gerdts) and Ferd Larssen (Herrmann) dated at Havana, Cuba (Rec. pp. 2373 - 2392). The Agent traced the activities of Gerdts and Herrmann in Havana and on page 2391, made the following report of what happened at and after dinner at the Hotel Florida on March 10, 1917: " While eating in came both Larssen [Herrmann] and Pichot [Gerdts], they looked about as if hunting for some one, then went out. Agent then picked em up again at the Plaza, bought em a cigar smoked and talked with them for a while, then Larssen [Herrmann] bought two of the latest American Magazines and said he was going to his room." (Emphasis supplied.) Here we have a report on March 10, 1917, that Herrmann, about a month before leaving Havana for Mexico, purchased two late American magazines. In reply to the question whether he recalled the actual circumstances -surrounding the preparation of the message, Herrmann said (Ex. 986, Ann. A, p. 145): " I only remembered that it was written while we stopped at Paglasch's Hotel, which was called the Juarez, and that Siegel and Raoul were with me, but as to the</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">DÉCISIONS</h3>
<p>357 exact details of the circumstances my memory had through the years become rather vague until it was refreshed at the time of the talk I had with Siegel in Tallinn in 1932; then all the circumstances were brought back to my mind. " Q,- What were the circumstances under which the message was prepared? " A. We sat in our room on the balcony in the back of Paglasch's Hotel. We pulled the table or the wash stand out in front of the window. Siegel and I first prepared the message on paper with a lead pencil, figuring out the code numbers and everything. I then took the magazine and Siegel dictated the message to me and I wrote it in the magazine in lemon juice. Raoul was standing around the room. The message, I recall, was written in the afternoon. The following morning early Raoul left for the States by train." He testified that Raoul was away about three weeks and they were worried, as they expected him back at the most in ten days or two weeks, so he sent a second wire to Hildegarde, the substance of which was "Just asking if he had arrived, if she had seen him, or something similar " (id. p. 146) He then identified the telegram from Ex. 587, Rec. p. 2478, dated May 6, 1917, reading : " Have you seen Raoul? Answer immediately Hotel Juarez Greetings " signed " F. March ", as the telegram which was sent by him. In his affidavit of November 15, 1932 (Ex. 950, filed November 15, 1932), Herrmann again testified in regard to the circumstances connected with the Blue Book message which had been already filed as Ex. 904. In explaining the circumstances connected with the identification of the message he said: " When I identified the message in May, 1931, I did not have an opportunity to closely examine the magazine, which I had not seen from the time I handed it to Gerdts in April, 1917, until Hilken showed it to the claimants. " Hinsch's testimony confirmed the recollection which I had when testifying in Washington in April, 1930, that there were two messages. I spoke of them as 'a couple of letters ', and my best recollection was that there were two messages though I could not remember exactly what I had written. In fact, I recalled the details of the one which is in evidence only because I recognized the magazine and my writing therein. " The last page of the last story in the magazine, I observe, is now missing. It is my recollection that this page contained a short note in lemon juice, including an explanation of the code. " In so far as Hinsch now states that the message was written in a book on a plain page and not in this Blue Book Magazine, his statement is entirely false, as is also his description of the contents of the message. Hilken was already acquainted with Gerdts when I first met the latter through Woehst."</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-2"><span class="para-num">2.</span><p>Siegel Adam Siegel, who after the message had been composed and written by- Herrmann, dictated it to Herrmann for transcription in secret form, traveled with Herrmann and Gerdts in March or April, 1917, on the steamer en route from Havana to Vera Cruz. Siegel was an electrical engineer who served the German Government in Russia. The first mention of him in the record is found in a voluntary statement given by Lothar Witzke on September 18, 1919, to Captain Thomas J. Tunney. Special Investigator, United States Military Intelligence Division (Ex. 24, Rec. pp. 55, 92-95). In this statement Witzke described two secret agents of the German Government, one named Siegel and the other named Rodriguez (Herr- 24</p></div>
<p>358</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNIED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>mann). The description of Siegel is in some particulars incorrect, and the description of Rodriguez (Herrmann) is evidently the description of Herrmann. Witzke reported that both of these men operated in New York in the early part of the year 1916 under the supervision of the captain of the North German Lloyd Steamship Company (Hinsch), who " was in charge of the tug-boat that took in the submarine Deu^chland in Baltimore on the first trip." The state- ment then has the following information: " After the declaration of war by the United States against Germany, both of these men worked under the same captain in Mexico City. Siegel was sent as a Russian to the Panama Canal around June 1917. Rodriguez worked during the early part of the European war in England. Both of these men may be connected with or have some information regarding who was responsible for the Black Tom Explosion. Both of them left the United States to Cuba and thence to Mexico about April 4, 1917. I met both of these men in Mexico City." (id. p. 93) Later Witzke supplied the name of the captain who was in charge of Siegel and Rodriguez as " Captain Frederick Hintsh or Hintch." He related as- follows : ~™ ™~ " Siegel's first name is Adam; he lived at the Hotel Juarez in Mexico City; was an electrical engineer by profession; spoke Russian fluently; was a Reserve German Cavalry Officer; of South German birth; interned in Russia where he was at the outbreak of the ear; escaped from Siberia and landed in San Francisco. Siegel was in New York in 1916 at the time of the Black Tom Explosion. He was very intelligent and a real patriotic German." (id. pp. 94, 95) Gerdts met Siegel on a steamer in the port of Havana while he and Herrmann were en route to Vera Cruz (Ex. 626-a, Rec. pp. 2768-2774). While in Mexico, Siegel was associated with Herrmann, Gerdts and Major R. Schwierz, a major in the Mexican Army, who was reported to have come from the German garrison at Tsingtau (Ex. 626-a, Rec. p. 2768, Ex. 583, Rec. p. 2422). In a report dated September 16, 1917, Frederick Simpich, American Consul at Guaymas, Mexico, informed the Secretary of State that Siegel and Fred March (Herrmann) had been cooperating with Rademacher, German Consular Agent at Guaymas, and with Major Schwierz of the Mexican Army, and they had been very active in Sonora and lower California, within the preceding two weeks. March's false passport had been obtained from the Mexican Consul General in Cuba, was dated March 5, 1917, bore March's photograph and had on it this legend : " Gesehen, v. Eckardt, 21 Mai. 17 ". (id. Rec. p. 2422) In Cuba Siegel was reported to have participated in a negro uprising and he represented himself to the Russian mission in Cuba as a Russian revolutionary, studying labor conditions in Mexico and the United States; and he was also represented to have been in communication with an I. W. W, leader at Bisbee, Arizona (id. Rec. p. 2422). After arriving in Guaymas, Siegel and March (Herrmann) made an extensive trip into lower California and worked their way north and emerged at Los Angeles Bay (Mexico), where a small wireless had been in commission in June last. They returned to Santa Ana, Sonora, and from that place they went to Guaymas. While at Santa Ana, March received telegrams from Rademacher and Schwierz. On July 16th Major Schwierz telegraphed in German to Siegel ordering him to proceed to Mexico City (id. Rec. p. 2423). In an affidavit of A. E. W. Mason dated February 15, 1929 (Ex. 625, Rec. p. 2756 et seq.), Mason, a British subject, and a captain in the British Army, and formerly a member of the British Parliament, who was transferred to the</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>359 British Naval Intelligence Service under Sir Reginald Hall, says that: In No- vember, 1917, he was sent on duty to Mexico, and there became familiar with the activities of German agents in Mexico, both before and after his arrival. From information gained by him, Mason was convinced that von Eckardt, the German Minister, was personally familiar with the operations of the German agents in Mexico, amongst whom were Jahnke, Witzke, Bode, Siegel, Hinsch, and Paglasch, the proprietor of the Juarez Hotel, which was a rendezvous for German agents. Mason was the employer of the negro, William Gleaves (Rec. pp. 2756-2759). During the time he was in Mexico, Witzke crossed the border several times, but was finally arrested by the American police with the aid of Gleaves, and they discovered a letter in the lining of his jacket which was from Eckardt, recommending Witzke as a man who could be relied upon for any dangerous work (Ex. 625, Rec. p. 2761). In the report to the State Department of Guyant, American Consul at Barranquilla, Colombia, dated August 24, 1917, Gerdts had stated that, follow- ing his arrival in Mexico City, he met two Germans, Siegel and Schwierz, a major in the Mexican Army, en route from Havana to Mexico (Ex. 583, Ann. H, Rec. p. 2351). When Hilken was first examined the description of Siegel as given by Witzke was read to him but he said : " I don't remember him at all." (Ex. 583, Rec. pp. 2239, 2242) Siegel has made two principal statements showing his connection with the drafting of the Herrmann message, the one found in Exhibit 908, filed May 27, 1932, which was written entirely in Siegel's own handwriting; the other, found in German Annex 69, verified on the 15th day of July, 1932, and filed August 27, 1932. In his first statement, Siegel relates that he met Herrmann and Gerdts in March or April, 1917, on a steamer en route from Havana to Vera Cruz. From Vera Cruz they went to Mexico City by rail and stopped at Hotel Cosmos. They met Major Schwierz of the Mexican Army, at whose advice they moved to the Hotel Juarez, belonging to a certain Otto Paglasch. He related to Herrmann (1) his escape from Russian internment; (2) his lack of money; and (3) his desire to do something in the interests of Germany. On the day after their arrival Herrmann and Gerdts (Pochet) went to see the German Minister, von Eckardt, and a few days later Siegel accepted employment by Herrmann, and Herrmann enlightened Siegel " about his activities, and it was decided to send Raoul Pochet to Baltimore to obtain funds." An analysis of the description of the message by Siegel is as follows : (1) It was written in an American magazine; (2) Crosswise to the print; (3) In lemon juice; (4) On several pages of the magazine ; (5) Partly in normal writing, partly in code; (6) The code words in cipher were to be deciphered in a certain way by means of perforations with a needle; (7) The report was first drawn up on a sheet of paper; (8) It was dictated by Siegel to Herrmann; (9) Herrmann wrote it in the already-mentioned magazine. Siegel related the events following Gerdts' departure as follows: Raoul Pochet (Gerdts) " returned from the U.S.A. about the middle of May " with much less money than Herrmann expected or had asked for. He reported that Hinsch would shortly come and bring along the needed funds.</p>
<p>360</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>Siegel identified a magazine shown to him by Herrmann as similar to the one used to send to Baltimore; and he likewise identified " the photographs of the printed pages on which the report to Baltimore was written in lemon juice at that time." These photographs were each signed by Siegel. Siegel's second statement (Ger. Ann. 69), may be analyzed as follows: On March 14, 1932, Herrmann, to his surprise, came to Siegel's office. Herrmann did not mention his purpose until next day. Herrmann represented: (1) The Governments were engaged in clearing the sabotage matter and it was necessary to learn something concerning a secret message once sent to the United States. (2) Herrmann had undertaken the trip from Chile upon the advice and at the expense of the German Government ; (3) He came from Berlin under order of the German Government and had been instructed to deliver his material in Berlin. Siegel assumed: (1) That Herrmann's material " would form the subject of diplomatic negoti- ations "; and (2) " That Herrmann wanted to place his own activities in the right light before the German authorities." His first statement was given in order to assist Herrmann and the German Government. He went to Herrmann's hotel and they discussed for about an hour the text of the statement. He decided to write the statement holographically. He decided to have the signature attested at the German Consulate, because he " considered it unwise to state in a protocol before an Estonian notary matters of the wartime." The next day Siegel took the necessary steps at the German Consulate and Herrmann departed that evening, leaving his address in Berlin. To that address Siegel was to send three photographs brought by Herrmann to Siegel, of which Siegel had copies made. Later the photographs were sent but came back as undeliverable. Herrmann failed to tell Siegel : (1) That he was traveling with an American attorney; (2) That he had called at the American Consulate; (3) Anything of the German-American Mixed Claims Commission, or of its composition ; (4) That Siegel's statement was to be submitted to that Commission (Siegel's assumption being that his statement was to be used by Germany as '" the subject of diplomatic negotiations ") ; (5) That Herrmann had testified before the Commission; (6) That Siegel's statement was to be used to support Herrmann's statement. Comparisons : " Had I had any idea that my statement was to be used in a litigation before an international tribunal, I would have acted differently." (Emphasis supplied.) (He probably means that he would have refused to testify.) As regards his first statement of March 16, 1932, he states as follows: Being under oath to-day he can now state only what he can actually answer for according to his recollection of matters dating so far back, whereas in the statement of March</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>361 16th lie relied on what Herrmann told him. Most of the items Herrmann called to his memory and they jointly reconstructed the things. The statements on page 1 are, on the whole, correct. He still renumbers with certainty : (1) That Herrmann needed money; (2) That Gerdts was sent to the United States to procure money; (3) That Gerdts was given a secret message; (4) That its substance was to give money to the bearer to take back with him; (5) The urgent request for money was what he had in mind when he used the words '" necessary communications ". He remembers and confirms : ( 1 ) That Gerdts stayed a long time ; (2) That Gerdts brought with him only a comparatively small amount of money ; (3) That Herrmann was disappointed; (4) Herrmann's drafting the message without Siegel's participation; (5) Herrmann asked Siegel to dictate it; (6) The message was written in a printed volume; (7) That the message was " longer than one sentence otherwise I would not have had to dictate it." He is not certain : (1) Whether a magazine or a book was used. (2) Whether the printed volume was smaller than the sheets shown by Herrmann. From a comparison of these statements certain clear deductions may be made. Siegel was not in a position to deny, and did not deny, the truth of his first statement, but endeavored to throw doubt upon some of the statements therein by arguments rather than by denials. If it be admitted that Herrmann's repre- sentations to Siegel were false, were those representations and Siegel's assumptions of such a character as to cast doubt upon the first statement or to induce Siegel to make false statements with regard to the message? Were the matters alleged to have been suppressed by Herrmann the cause of any error or misstatement by Siegel? The object of Siegel's second statement was not directly to contradict the first statement, but to cast some doubt upon the verity of his first statement, first, because Herrmann allegedly made false representations; second, because of the assumptions made by Siegel and, third, because Herrmann suppressed certain information which he ought to have disclosed. Herrmann's allegedly false representations were based upon the idea that the German Government was anxious to clear up the sabotage cases and, therefore, had secured Herrmann's services for that purpose. These allegedly false repre- sentations and Siegel's assumptions that the material furnished Herrmann would form the subject of diplomatic negotiations and that Herrmann wanted to place his own activities in the right light before the German authorities, offered Siegel no excuse for making a false record or deviating from the truth. It is self-evident that the matters which Herrmann failed to bring to Siegel's attention could not have affected the verity of his statement, however much these matters might have affected his action in making the statement. The fact that Herrmann was traveling with an American attorney; had called at the American Consulate and that there was such a tribunal as the German-Amer- ican Mixed Claims Commission before whom Siegel's statement would be sub- mitted; that Herrmann's testimony had been presented to the Commission and</p>
<p>362</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>that Siegel's statement would be used to support Herrmann's testimony, might have been used by Siegel as a reason for refusing to make any statement, but even if all these facts had been brought to him and, after a knowledge of them, he had made his statement, they would have been additional reasons for a careful and truthful statement but not for a statement which departed from the truth. In Exhibit 950, verified and filed November 15, 1932, referring to Siegel's second statement, Herrmann testified as follows: " In regard to Siegel's testimony I told him that the question of the responsibility for destruction work that had been done in the United States before it got into the war, was now before an international commission composed of Americans and Germans, and that the German officials had said that they wanted to get at the truth. I did not tell Siegel as to whether I wanted his statement for one side rather than the other, but did say that the Commission was supposed to be neutral. I am sure that Siegel understood this completely and fully when he wrote out in his own handwriting the statement which he gave me. He certainly examined care- fully the language of the message and there was never a shadow of doubt exhibited by him in our entire interview indicating that he did not fully remember the cir- cumstances and the document as the one which he helped me to prepare in Mexico. Siegel asked me about the names represented by numbers, and I told him all that I could remember, which was practically all of them." This statement is in accord with a letter written by Herrmann to Mr. H. H. Martin on April 4, 1932, the original of which was filed as Exhibit 1005, Ann. K, on April 26, 1938. See also Herrmann's testimony under subpoena in October, 1933 (Ex. 986, Ann, A, pp. 146, 193, 194). Whether we accept Siegel's account in his second statement or Herrmann's testimony as to what took place between them before Siegel wrote out his first statement, the differences are not of a sufficient character to destroy the verity of Siegel's first statement. Siegel's attempt to distinguish between his obligation in making a statement under oath, and his obligation in making a statement where his signature was witnessed before the German Consulate, is a mere quibble. Therefore, all the reasons which Siegel in his second statement adduced in order to becloud the efficacy of his first statement seem to indicate that, while Siegel was not willing to depose that his first statement contained falsehoods, he was perfectly willing for the Commission to make this inference. Under the circumstances, his first statement must be accepted as more in accord with the actual truth than his labored effort to becloud the same. In Hinsch's attack on the Herrmann message (Ger. Ann. 71) (to be thoroughly studied hereafter), Hinsch claimed that the secret message which Gerdts brought to Baltimore contained only three elements: first, an identification of Gerdts with an assurance that he could be trusted; second, a request for $20,000 or $25,000 to be transmitted by Gerdts; and, third, advice that Gerdts would report verbally about all other matters. It was also claimed that the message was on only one page. If Siegel's first statement be true, then Hinsch's claim is false. In his second statement in describing how the message was drafted, Siegel used the following language (Ger. Ann. 69, p. 3) : " The secret message came about in the following way : Herrmann had drafted it without my having anything to do with it and asked me—since it is difficult to write with invisible ink — to dictate it to him. This I did. * * * Nor do I longer recall today, whether the message took up one or more pages * * * It must certainly have been longer than one sentence otherwise I would not have had to dictate it."</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>363 In his first statement, Siegel stated that the message was written partly in normal writing, partly in code, and that the code words consisted of a cipher and were to be deciphered in a certain way by means of perforations with a needle (Ex. 908, Ann. C, p. 2). In his second statement Siegel uses the following language (Ger. Ann. 69, p. 5) : " Finally, as regards my statements about a ' code ' and decoding ' mittels Durch- stechung mit einer Nadel ' (by means of pricking with a needle), these are based on the following: " / recall that Herrmann had a code which consisted of a sheet on which there were, in squares, letters or names and figures, which could be folded so that two or more sheets were laid on top of each other and could be adjusted in a certain order. If a message with words coded in figures had arrived the recipient, who had the same code, on his part had to adjust this code according to a certain order agreed upon and then found the clear text by pushing or pricking through the figures on the sheet of his code lying on top, with a pointed object, as a pencil or needle, and then assembling on the sheet lying underneath the corresponding words. I cannot say whether this procedure was used in the instant case since I did not personally frame the message and also was not present when it was received. I was, however, present when the writing was done and the printed volume was handed toGerdts and know positively that during that time single sheets of the printed volume were not pricked with a needle under certain letters. I hear for the first time of such a system as can not very well be called decoding in the proper sense, but simply a reading from pricked letters. Nor do I recall that Herrmann told me anything about this." (Emphasis supplied.) An examination of the explanation in the second statement will show that, whatever else Siegel had in mind, he did not deny, but he actually affirmed, that Herrmann in preparing the secret message used a code. An examination of the coded and decoded message (Ex. 904 (3) ) will show that the coded words are in all cases proper names with one exception, namely, the word " cruiser ". An examination of the message as described by Hinsch will show that such a message would not require to be coded, and, as Siegel says in his second statement, would not require to be dictated. Therefore, a careful analysis of Siegel's second statement absolutely disproves the claims made by Hinsch with reference to the message, and, in the last analysis throws no doubt upon Siegel's first statement, but rather tends to show that Siegel's second statement was a labored effort on the part of Ger- many's representatives by many words to raise a cloud of doubt rather than directly to attack Siegel's first statement on the ground that Siegel lied when he made his first statement.</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-3"><span class="para-num">3.</span><p>Gerdts Gerdts' History Before He Brought the Herrmann Message As we have already seen, Gerdts was the messenger who brought the message from Herrmann to New York on April 21, 1917, the day after Hoppenberg's death. He then took the message to Hilken at Baltimore. Gerdts' father was a German and his mother was a Colombian and, according to his own statement, he came to the United States in March, 1916, and remained until February, 1917. He was mentioned in Kaba's report to the Department of Justice dated May 19,1917, Annex X to Ex. 583 (Rec. pp. 2406 et seq.). The information in that report came from a Miss McPherson, who was a friend of Gerdts' mother and also of Hildegarde Jacobsen, Woehst's cousin. Through her Miss McPher- son met Woehst, under the name of Hauten; Herrmann, under the name of March, and Gerdts. When Woehst left on the steamship " Frederick VIII ",</p></div>

<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>on which Count Bernstorff departed. Miss McPherson, Gerdts, Herrmann, and Miss Jacobsen saw him off (Rec. p. 2408). In a statement to the Department of Justice made by A. G. Adams on February 21, 1917. relating to William Woeh(r)st (Ex. 583, Ann. K, Rec. pp. 2359 et seq.) it is related that a Spaniard, whose first name was Raoul, used to call frequently at the apartment at 600 West 115th Street, New York City, used by March (Herrmann) and Hauten (Woehst), and that after Woehst's departure Gerdts lived at the apartment. The succeeding reports (Anns. L, M, N, O, P, Q., R, X, and Y, Rec. pp. 2363-2410), trace the activities of Herrmann, Woehst and Gerdts until Woehst sailed for Germany and Gerdts and Herrmann arrived in Mexico and, when taken into consideration with other portions of the record, show clearly that Gerdts, Herrmann and Woehst were all engaged in sabotage in this country while the United States was neutral. Herrmann testified that he met Gerdts in an apartment on 116th Street; that he was introduced to him by Willie Woehst, and that Woehst secured a job for Gerdts though Hilken, who sent him to some brewery to work, but he got fired the next day (Rec. p. 5461). Herrmann further testified that when he left the United States he took Gerdts with him to Havana because Gerdts could speak Spanish and Herrmann could not (Rec. p. 5461). This testimony of Herrmann is fully confirmed by the reports to the Department of Justice referred to above. Gerdts Brings the Herrmann Message to Hilken in Baltimore As we have seen above, Ahrendt's affidavit, German Annex 73, was introduced for the specific purpose of showing that Gerdts never brought a written message from Herrmann to Hilken. In the examination of Herrmann at Washington, April 3, 1930 (Rec. pp. 5431 et seq.), Herrmann told of his introduction to Gerdts by Woehst. Gerdts lived in his apartment and got his meals there, and when Herrmann left the country and went to Havana he took Gerdts with him. Herrmann states: " Yes; he went with me to Mexico City, and he was there I imagine about a month or five weeks or something like that. I sent him up to Paul Hilken with a couple of letters. " Q,. What were those letters about? A. Asking about Captain Hinsch, asking if any new instructions had come, and so forth." (Rec. p. 5461). The first time that Gerdts ever made a record or report on the subject matter of his trip from Mexico to Baltimore was on July 29, 1917, when he made a report to S. LeRoy Layton, American Vice Consul at Barranquilla, Colombia (Ann. G to Ex. 583, Rec. p. 2346). Mr. Layton was transferred from Colombia to Hamilton, Canada, as the American Vice Consul ; and under date of August 1, 1917, he made a report to the Secretary of State on the subject " Plot to blow up the oil wells at Tampico, Mexico by a German-American. " In his report to Layton, Gerdts claimed to be anxious to give his information to the United States and willing to go to Washington and explain everything more fully, if the Government would provide transportation and a position for him (Rec. p. 2348). Layton's report to the Secretary of State relates the " sensational story as told to the writer by Mr. Raul VV. Gerdts Pochet of Barran- quilla, Colombia, on July 29, 1917, prior to my departure for my new post at Hamilton, Canada." According to this report, Gerdts met a German-American (Herrmann) in February. 1917, in New York City, who offered him a position as traveling</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>365 secretary. Gerdts accepted and sailed on the S.S. " factories " in February for Havana. Gerdts and the German-American left Havana in March for Vera Cruz and they went thence to Mexico City. His employer sent him to New York by train with some letters which he delivered, and, upon his return to Mexico City, his employer offered him a weekly salary of $200.00. expenses and a bonus of $5000.00, if Gerdts would accompany him to Tampico and assist in blowing up the oil wells, which Gerdts refused to do. His employer showed him several small tubes about the size of a cigarette and about five inches long and told him that the tubes contained chemicals, and, when placed in a certain position, the chemicals ran down the tubes and at a given time caused combustion with dynamite by a time fuse, and he was told that these tubes were used to destroy munitions plants in the United States. Gerdts refused and asked his employer to pay his transportation to New York, which the employer refused, and a fight followed. He was given enough money to pay for his passage to Havana and by telegraphing to his relatives got funds with which to return home. His employer resided in a little town near Elizabeth, N. J., but he was afraid to give the name of his employer. Layton reported that he had ascertained that R. G. Pochet sailed on the S. S. " Pastories " (not" Factories ") on February 24, 1917, to Havana, occupying stateroom 48 with Fred Larssen (Herrmann). Layton's report was, on August 14. 1917, referred by the Department of State to Claude E. Guyant, American Consul at Barranquilla, Colombia, and under date of August 24, 1917, he made a report to the Secretary of State on the subject "Raoul Pochet, employee of German Agent Herrmann " (Ann. H to Ex. 583, Rec. pp. 2349 et seq.). Consul Guyant reported as follows: Gerdts, while in New York, sought work unsuccessfully and finally obtained a position as chauffeur for Herrmann. Gerdts drove his car and acted as personal servant to Herrmann. Herrmann made one short trip to Savannah, for what purpose Gerdts was not aware. In February or March Herrmann sailed for Cuba, taking Gerdts with him. In packing up Herrmann's effects, Gerdts noticed a number of small tubes, and when asked what they were for, Herrmann told him " It was none of his business ". Upon arriving at Havana, Herrmann placed these tubes in Gerdts' baggage, but Gerdts took them out and replaced them in Herrmann's effects. Gerdts remained with Herrmann in Havana about a month, during which time Herrmann told him that the tubes contained two acids, which, when mixed, would start a fierce combustion, and that he intended to use them for setting rtre to munitions factories. From Havana they went to Vera Cruz, and thence to Mexico City, where they met two other Germans, Adam Siegel and Major Schwierz of the Mexican Army. After being in Mexico City about two weeks, doing nothing " He was ordered by Hermann to proceed to New York by rail with a verbal order for $25,000.00 to be received from one Hoppenberg having offices in the Whitehall Building, New York City. Gerdts states that he proceeded to New York on these orders and went to the offices of this Hoppenberg who, he states, was agent for the German submarine ' Deutchland'. Hoppenberg he reports, died suddenly the day previous to his arrival in New York City and he was not able to obtain the $25,000.00. He returned to Mexico City overland and states that Hermann and his associates offered to pay him 525,000.00 if he would proceed to Tampico and blow up some of the oil tanks or wells at that place. He states that he refused to do this and that shortly afterward the Germans * * * * finally told him they had no further use for him." Vice Consul Layton, a week before his departure from Barranquilla, after he had learned from Raoul and his brother, Hans, the clerk in the American</p>
<p>366</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>Consulate of Barranquilla, details of Gerdts' transactions with Herrmann, urged Gerdts not to say anything to Mr. Guyant about the matter, and promised that he, Layton, would do all possible to confirm the report upon reaching New York, and would take the matter up in Washington with a view to getting a large reward for obtaining the information, which reward was to be divided between him and Gerdts. Guyant reported that on account of Lay ton's promise of a large reward, Gerdts' mind was poisoned, and he refused to give a written statement. According to the report of Layton, Gerdts was sent by Herrmann to New York by train with some letters which he delivered. According to the report of Guyant, Gerdts was ordered by Herrmann to proceed to New York by rail with a verbal order for $25,000 to be received from one Hoppenberg. How Gerdts' Affidavit was Secured, Payment Therefor Before any controversy arose as to the character of the message brought by Gerdts to Hilken and before Hilken ever produced the Blue Book message, the American Agent was anxious to, and did finally, secure the testimony of Gerdts. How this testimony was secured is related in a letter from L. A. Peto and Amos J. Peaslee to the American Agent transmitting Gerdts' affidavit, dated January 18, 1929 (See Ex. 626 (b), Rec. pp. 2794 el seq.). From this letter it appears that Mr. Peto and Mr. Peaslee went to Barranquilla for the purpose of endeavoring to examine Gerdts, but he refused until he was compensated for his information and demanded $100,000 before he would make any statement. The only thing which Gerdts was willing to tell these gentlemen orally was " that he had information, obtained while he was associated with Fred Hermann, which he believed had quite a direct bearing upon both the destruction of the Black Tom Terminal and the Kingsland Plant. Mr. Gerdts finally stated that the minimum reward which he was prepared to consider was $10,000. He declined either to discuss what the nature of his information was or to discuss the cases further unless it was agreed that such a reward would be paid." Mr. Peto finally informed Gerdts that his company was prepared to pay the reward unless there was objection from the American Agent's office. The gentlemen had prepared a series of interrogatories to be submitted to Gerdts and left these interrogatories with him, together with the attached exhibits, and advised Gerdts that, if he would go through the papers during their absence and prepare his answers and deliver the questions and answers to them upon their return, the reward would be paid, unless the American Agent indicated any objection to that procedure. They received word from the office of the American Agent to proceed in whatever way seemed best under the circumstances, so Gerdts delivered to them his statement (Ex. 626 (a), Rec. p. 2765) and the reward was paid. Gerdts' First Affidavit In his affidavit Gerdts was shown, and confirmed, the reports of Vice Consul Layton and of Consul Guyant, as " absolutely correct ", and he also expressed his willingness to declare everything he knew about the matter pending before the Mined Claims Commission. He confirms the report of the trip of Herrmann and himself from the United States via Havana, to Vera Cruz, and Vera Cruz to Mexico City, where he stayed twelve days. In answer to the question where he first met Captain Hinsch and the nature of his acquaintance with him, he replied as follows (Rec. p. 2772):</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>367 " I was ordered by Herrmann to go from Mexico to New York with an order to collect S25,000 from Hoppenberg and to bring the money back personally to him (Hermann) in Mexico City. I remember that the order and instructions given to me by Hermann were written in lemon juice on a page in a book of poetry. The lemon juice made the writing invisible and for that reason I did not know the exact contents of the order. The address of Hoppenberg which Hermann gave me was ' Pearl Street, New York '. When I arrived there I was told that Hoppenberg had died the previous day. In the same book of poetry there was another order, also written in lemon juice, to the effect that in the event that I should not find Hoppenberg in New York I was to deliver the order to Paul Hilken, in Baltimore, where I went that day. I remember that when I arrived at Mr. Hilken's home and asked for him, a woman, probably thinking that I had some business of interest to Mr. Hilken, told me to leave the house immediately and come back in about a half hour because at that time special investigators were inspecting the house. I returned some time later and found Mr. Hilken to whom I gave the page from the book of poetry. He went to the cellar of the house to decipher the order and then told me that he did not have that amount of money, but that I should stay at his home while he went to New York to procure the money. Three days later he returned and told me that he was going to send the money, but that another friend of his who he expected in a few months was going to take the money to Mexico. Shortly afterwards a man was introduced to me as Captain Hinsch. He told me that he was a Captain of the North German Lloyd that towed the steamer ' Deutchland ' to the harbor at Baltimore. He told me to go back to Mexico, and gave me a $1,000. The balance of $24,000 he told me he was going to take himself. He asked me to tell Hermann that he (Hinsch) was busily engaged in getting guns of 7.05 millimeters across the border into Mexico which were to be used to equip a destroyer in Mazatlan, intercepting ships carrying cargoes from San Francisco. He told me to tell Hermann to enlist the two hundred men that were required to man the destroyer, which Hinsch himself was to command. This was how I met Captain Hinsch and this was the nature of my relationship with him. I have not seen him since." (Emphasis supplied.) He met Siegel on the S.S. " Monterrey " (" Monserrat "), of the Ward Line, in the harbor of Havana, when Siegel came aboard and sailed with Herrmann and Gerdts to Mexico, and he learned that Siegel was an engineer who had been a prisoner of war in Siberia and escaped from prison, going first to China and then to the United States by way of San Francisco (Rec. p. 2774). He confirmed the report of Consul Layton that Herrmann in Mexico had offered him a " bonus of $5,000.00 " if Gerdts " would accompany him to Tampico to assist him to blow up the oil wells." He also confirmed the report of Consul Layton that Herrmann and his associates offered to pay him $25,000 if he would proceed to Tampico and blow up some of the oil tanks or wells at that place, and when he refused, Herrmann discharged him (Rec. p. 2774). His relations with Herrmann at the end were very disagreeable (Rec. p. 2775). Herrmann's associates were Siegel, Schwierz and Paglasch (Rec. p. 2776). Gerdts' Second Affidavit In Exhibit 979, Ann. A, verified July 17, 1933, Gerdts testified again about some of the circumstances connected with the Herrmann message. He testified first, that he had met Paul Hilken four or five times in New York and also in Baltimore with Hinsch; second, he knew that lemon juice was used by Herrmann " Because I bought the lemon myself and brought the lemon to Hermann to the Hotel Paglach, Avenida Juarez, Mexico City, where we were living and I saw him writing the message myself"; third, that he was with Herrmann when he was writing the message; fourth, that he told Hilken how to make the writing appear with a hot iron, and Hilken</p>
<p>368</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>went down to the cellar, and, after half an hour, he came up again to the room and said that everything was all right. He didn't see the message after it was deciphered. However, " I saw the message before it was brought out by the use of a hot iron because it was possible to read it by holding the pages on which it was written up to the light." He was shown photostatic pages from the original Blue Book containing the developed message, and said: " I recognize it is a copy of the message I carried to Baltimore." and he signed each page. There are some differences in the various statements in the record made by Gerdts with reference to the Herrmann message. In the report of Vice Consul Layton, made on August 1, 1917 (Ex. 583, Ann. G, p. 2347), Gerdts stated: " He [Herrmann] sent me to New York by train with some letters, which I delivered." (Emphasis supplied.) In the report of Guyant, American Consul at Barranquilla (Ex. 583, Ann. H, Rec. p. 2350), made twenty-three days later on August 24, 1917, Guyant reported to the State Department as follows: " He * * * was ordered by Hermann to proceed to New York by rail with a verbal order for S25,000.00 to be received from one Hoppenberg having offices in the Whitehall Building, New York City." (Emphasis supplied.) In Exhibit 626 (a), verified January 11, 1929, Gerdts confirmed as correct the reports of Vice Consul Layton and Consul Guyant (Rec. p. 2767), but he recalled that the order and instructions were written in lemon juice on a page in a book of poetry, and he states that in the same book of poetry there was another order, also written in lemon juice in event he did not find Hoppenberg in New York he was to deliver the order to Paul Hilken in Baltimore (Rec. p. 2772). He went to Baltimore and finding that Hilken was not at home he returned later " And found Mr. Hilken to whom I gave the page from the book of poetry." (Rec. p. 2773) On page 2789 the following queries and answers occur: " Q.57. The report of Consul Guyant (annex D) states that after you reached Mexico City in 1917, Hermann ordered you to proceed to New York by rail ' with a verbal order for 825,000.00 to be received from one Hoppenberg, having offices in the Whitehall Building, New York City '. Is this statement correct? A. This statement is correct, as I have already stated. " Q58. Consul Layton's report (annex C) also states that you went to New York pursuant to that order of Hermann's and found that Hoppenberg had died. Is this statement correct? A. Absolutely correct." His affidavit on January 11, 1929, was given nearly two years before Hilken claims to have found the Blue Book in his attic in Baltimore, and of course the reports of Layton and Guyant, being made in 1917. could not have had any relation or reference to the subsequent controversy as to the message being contained in the Blue Book. It would seem that, on this point, Gerdts' apparent contradictions are due to the defects of an inaccurate memory and not to an intention to deceive. When he was making his statements to Layton and Guyant his main idea was to be rewarded by securing a " position " from the Government of the United States;</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>369 and if his testimony was hurtful to Herrmann, he was no longer under obligations to his former employer. When he made his affidavit of January 11, 1929, he was not in any way trying to verify any controversial point as to the character of the message transported by him, for at that time the Herrmann message had not been produced and it was not until June 28, 1932, almost 3 1/2 years later, that the controversy was finally raised by Hinsch (Ger. Ann. 71). 1 Gerdts was endeavoring to connect Herrmann and Hinsch with sabotage activities, particularly with the Kingsland and Black Tom disasters. His description of the message which he brought from Mexico to New York was only an incident in that effort. Instead of speaking of a verbal order he now tells of two orders written in a book ojpoetry, and he claims to have given a page from the book of poetry to Hilken, but he still verifies his report to Guyant that it was only a verbal order for $25,000, and his report to Lay ton that he carried some letters and delivered them. There was one other difference in his statements which should be mentioned. In his affidavit of January 11, 1929, he says " The lemon juice made the writing invisible and for that reason I did not know the exact contents of the order."' (Ex. 626 (a), Rec. p. 2772.) In his affidavit of July 17, 1933, he said: " I didn't see the message after it was deciphered. However I saw the message before it was brought out by the use of a hot iron because it was possible to read it by holding the pages on which it was written up to the light." (Ex. 979, Ann. A.) That this may have been possible seems to be confirmed by the testimony of Hilken in Exhibit 976, Ann. E, p. 116, taken September 7th to 16th, 1933. In that deposition, Hilken testified that he took the magazine down into the cellar and used a hot iron to bring out the lemon juice. He remembered saying to Gerdts, " Why, that is almost yellow enough to read without ironing." Although each of Gerdts' reports varies from the others, taken as a whole they confirm Herrmann's and Hilken's testimony in regard to the Blue Book message in three essential particulars; First, it contained a request for money; Second, the message indicated that the bearer would relate verbally the particulars; and Third, the message was written in lemon juice. It is significant that in attacking the Blue Book message Hinsch stated that the text of the message contained : " an identification of Gerdts, the request for $20,000 or 525,000 to be transmitted by Gerdts, and the advice that Gerdts would report verbally about all other matters. That was all." (Ger. Ann. 71, p. 3.) It will be recalled in this connection that the Blue Book message concludes as follows: " Most important send funds. Bearer will relate experiences and details. Greetings."</p>

<p>" I am submitting herewith a photograph of four (4) pages of a document which I found in a box of books and papers in the attic of my old house in Baltimore, during the recent search, and which document is an issue of the Blue Book Magazine for the month of January 1917 and which was sent to me in April 1917 by Fred Herrmann. This original magazine has been delivered by me to the Claimants, in support of my previous testimony." In describing the original reception of the message, Hilken uses the following language: " Raoul Gerdts brought this magazine from Mexico to me in Baltimore. My 1917 diary shows the date of his arrival as April 29, 1917. Gerdts told me that this magazine contained a message in invisible writing and also told me the page on which the message commenced. The attached photograph shows that the page number on which the message commences is page 700 and the message continues consecutively on pages 698, 696, and 694 on which page the message concludes. Gerdts remained with me while I raised the message by means of a hot iron. The message was written by Fred Herrmann whose handwriting I recognized." A careful examination of the record disloses that Hilken was mistaken in saying that his diary showed that Gerdts' arrival was April 29, 1917. As a matter of fact, his diary shows that on April 27th he paid Gerdts $175 and on April 29th Gerdts and Hinsch dined with him in his home at Roland Park. In Exhibit 976, Annex E, p. 115, Hilken testified that in April, 1917, Raoul Gerdts Pochet, brought him the Blue Book of January, 1917, containing the secret message. Hilken took the magazine down into the cellar and ironed it out, that is to say, he used a hot iron to bring out the lemon juice. He remem- bered saying to Gerdts: " Why, that is almost yellow enough to read without ironing." He does not remember whether Gerdts was present when he heated the pages of the magazine, but Gerdts was certainly in the house. Gerdts did not know what was in the message, otherwise it would not have been necessary for Herrmann to write out a message in lemon juice. All Gerdts knew was that he was to bring back $25,000 (id. p. 116). Gerdts did not speak English fluently, but did speak German and Spanish, and had great difficulty in making himself understood by Mrs. Hilken (id. p. 117). (2) Hilken already knew Gerdts and no introduction was necessary If the procuring of $25,000 was the sole purpose of sending Gerdts, there would have been no necessity for a secret message (id. p. 117). Hilken knew Gerdts in New York before Gerdts and Herrmann left for Cuba. Hilken related that Gerdts had frequently carried money from Hoppenberg to Herrmann, and stated that, if Gerdts had come to him and said Herrmann needed $25,000, Hilken would have accepted that as a fact. He might not have given him the whole $25,000, but he would have accepted it as a fact, and an introduction to Gerdts was not necessary as he had frequently met him in New York (id. p. 117). ! Hilken related an incident about Gerdts and Hoppenberg occurring in Decem- ber, 1916. Herrmann told him that Hinsch was being hounded for money; that 1 The claim of Hilken that he knew Gerdts before he left New York and that no introduction was necessary, was confirmed by the Hilken-Hoppenberg-Lowen- stein correspondence (see this opinion, p. 120) ; and also by Gerdts (Ex. 979 Ann. A, supra, this opinion, p. 183). {Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 323, and also p. 367.)</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>371 Hinsch had asked him, Herrmann, to pay off Kristoff. Herrmann sent Gerdts down to Hoppenberg for money, and Hilken wrote out a check, and Hoppenberg pinned the money in an inside pocket of Gerdts' coat. The thing that impressed him at the time was this huge Hoppenberg, who weighed about three hundred pounds, with " hands as big as bears ' paws, trying with a small safety pin to pin the money into Gerdts' coat pocket." Gerdts weighed about a hundred and ten pounds. This incident occurred sometime in December of 1916 (id. p. 118). On account of his recollection of this incident which was quite fresh in his. mind, there was no necessity whatever for Herrmann to give Gerdts a message introducing Gerdts to him and Herrmann knew that Hilken knew Gerdts (id. p. 120). Hoppenberg died Friday, April the 20th, 1917. He fixed this date by referring to his diary (id. p. 118). Hoppenberg died before Gerdts' arrival with the message in the magazine (id. p. 119). (3) Hilken goes to New London and brings Hinsch back to Baltimore After receiving the message and developing it, he made a transcript, and took the copy to New London for the purpose of discussing the message with Hinsch (id. pp. 116, 120). Gerdts did not accompany him. Hinsch and Hilken return- ed to Baltimore in order to consider the message with Gerdts, personally, and to talk about his crossing the border into Mexico (id. p. 120). He, however, did not remember this trip until he saw it stated in his diary for April 27th and 28th (id. p. 121). (4) Hilken and Hinsch's interview with Gerdts, Sunday April 29, 1917 Hinsch and Hilken saw Gerdts in Baltimore on Sunday, April 29th, at Hilken's house in Roland Park as shown by his diary. x The reason why Gerdts was spoken of in the diary as " cousin Raoul " was because they had distant cousins in Venezuela, and in order that the children, who were of an age t&amp; begin to take notice, would not be suspicious, they introduced him to them as " cousin Raoul " and the children called him " cousin Raoul " (id. p. 121). (5) Hinsch criticizes Herrmann's code in the message Hilken showed the message to Hinsch after they got to Baltimore, and Hinsch criticized Herrmann for using simply one number before the main number instead of adding a superfluous number at the end (id. pp. 121, 122). He identified the Blue Book, Exhibit 904, as " the Blue Book with the famous message which Raoul Gerdts brought to me in Baltimore in April, 1917 " and as the magazine which he showed Hinsch (id. p. 122). (6) Hilken's sabotage payments to Hinsch, May 1917 In Hilken's diary for May 1917, above the item for Thursday the 24th of May, occurs the figure " S 1,500 " and below the item for Saturday the 26th, occurs the figure " 23,361.75 " (Ex. 583, Ann. D). In the check stub book (Ex. 909, Ann. C) the item for May 24, 1917, is as follows: " No. 218 Pay to KNK for</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">H $1500 ".</h3>
<p>There is no corresponding item, however, for the sum of $23,361.75. Hilken explained that both of these items were for money given to Hinsch, the $1,500 1 This is confirmed by Hinsch (Ger. Ann. 71; supra, this opinion, p. 119). (Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 322.)</p>

<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMA.NY</h3>
<p>payment being on the 24th and the payment of $23,361.75 was on the 24th, 25th or 26th. He thinks that it was on the 24th (Ex. 976. Ann. E, pp. 126-129). The payment to Hinsch of the sum of $23,361.75 was not related in any way to the affairs of the Eastern Forwarding Company1 (id. pp. 129, 130). The cash book shows that the sum of $23.361.75 was drawn on the German-American Bank (id. p. 130). (7) Hilken and Hinsch send Gerdts back to Mexico with $1,000 Hinsch and Hilken sent Gerdts down to Mexico with $1,000. 2 Hilken confirms Gerdts' statement as to the message which Hinsch sent by him to Herrmann in Mexico with reference to getting guns across the border to be used in equipping a destroyer and enlisting two hundred men (id. p. 137). (8) Hilken knew Siegel He testified that he knew Siegel and knew what the reference in the message meant in saying " Tell him Siegel is with me " (id. p. 138). 3 (9) Hilken stores the message in the attic oj his home in Baltimore When he had talked over the message with Hinsch, he probably put it with other papers in his desk. Later on he stored it with a number of papers relating to his wartime activities in the attic of his house in Baltimore (Ex. 904 (3) ; Ex. 949, p. 3; Ex. 976, Ann. E, pp. 139-141). (10) Hilken's house was not being watched, when Gerdts came nor was it ever searched When Gerdts came with the message, his house was not being watched, as had been testified to by Gerdts; but Gerdts may have had in mind an incident, when some hoodlums in Roland Park had painted a sign, " To Hell with the Kaiser ", on the concrete walk leading from the street to his house and Mrs. Hilken had complained to the police, and it was possible that when Gerdts arrived, a policeman may have been there (Ex. 976, Ann. E, p. 139). Hilken's house was never searched, but in August, 1918, Parr, an investigator of the Department of Justice, went to Baltimore with Hilken to search for some papers desired by the Alien Property Custodian (id. p. 140). (11) Hilken discovers other papers with the message At the time he discovered the Herrmann message, he discovered also the Arnold letters and other correspondence which he had packed in a small box after he had taken them out from the eaves of his attic (Ex. 906). Additional correspondence was later found in the eaves of the attic. This was given to Mr. Martin, counsel for the American Agent (Ex. 976, Ann. E, p. 141). 1 This is confirmed by the testimony of Hilken, Sr. (Ex. 976, Anns. A—D. pp. 115-120). 2 This is confirmed by Hinsch (Ger. Ann. 71); Gerdts (Ex. 629, p. 2773); Herrmann (Ex. 904 (4), also Ex. 986. Ann. A, p. 152); and Siegel (Ex. 908). 3 In his examination of December 8. 1928, Hilken denied that he knew Siegel (Ex. 583, Rec. pp. 2239, 2242).</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>373 (12) Hilken and Herrmann and the Liberty articles In October, 1930, Herrmann found that Sidney Sutherland was working on his magazine articles in Peaslee's office and Herrmann " raised particular hell about it." Herrmann telegraphed Hilken to meet him in town and told Hilken all about the articles which were to appear in Liberty. He does not know exactly how the matter came to Herrmann's attention, but at any rate Herrmann immediately got in touch with Hilken. Hilken and Herrmann sought Mr. Peto and charged him with bad faith because, when Peto and Peaslee solicited Hilken's testimony in 1928, they promised Hilken the utmost protection against publicity, and Hilken never would have testified, if he had not had a definite promise of no publicity. This was on account of his family (id. pp. 142, 143). Hilken and Herrmann therefore cabled Peaslee in Paris, demanding that permis- sion granted to Sutherland be withdrawn. They assumed that Sutherland had been authorized by the office of Peaslee and thought that he was paying the firm for the privilege (id. p. 143). Hilken met the American Agent at the pier on his return from The Hague and explained the whole matter to him, and Bonynge said he knew nothing about it, and agreed with Hilken that it was a breach of good faith, and promised him to call a meeting to see what could be done about stopping the Liberty articles. He is not now charging Peaslee with breaking faith, but he was certainly under the impression at the time (id. pp. 143, 144). Bonynge knew that Hilken's testimony had been given under a promise of protection from publicity and not for the purpose of having it exploited for the benefit of magazine writers (id. p. 144). After Peaslee returned from Europe, Hilken learned how access to the records had been obtained by Coudert Brothers while Peaslee was abroad. Hilken called Doing, of Coudert Brothers, who was a friend of Sutherland, and endeavored to have him arrange an appointment for Hilken to see Sutherland. Everybody promised to use their influence to repress the magazine publication (id. p. 144). Sutherland refused to meet Hilken and stated he would only take orders from Patterson, President of the Liberty Magazine. Hilken made several efforts to see Patterson and had two or three conferences with his secretary but was un- successful ; finally he caught Sutherland in his reception room and had a stormy interview in which he called Sutherland a " grave digger " (id. p. 145). When asked " What has all this to do with the discovery of the message in the magazine'1 " Hilken replied (p. 145): " A. It has a great deal to do with my not producing it. After some of the articles had been published, but before my name had been mentioned, I again went to Liberty, and was waiting in the reception room for Mr. Patterson's secretary, when the receptionist at the desk said to a man who had entered, ' Oh, Mr. Suther- land, I have a letter for you ', and handed him a letter. I immediately confronted him, said, ' Are you Mr. Sutherland? ' He said, ' Yes '. I introduced myself as Mr. Hilken and I told him everything I could think of. I said to him, ' You think you are an author, but your friends and colleagues consider you nothing more than a grave digger.' He was furious, almost livid, and took out his spite on the poor receptionist who had mentioned his name, and disappeared in an inner office. That is all the satisfaction I ever got out of it." These conferences for the purpose of suppressing the magazine articles took place between the end of October, 1930, and February or March, 1931 (id. p. 146). He saw Mr. Bonynge during that period, but Mr. Bonynge did practi- cally nothing to help him. Hilken got his sister interested and she was a friend of Mrs. Patterson. He introduced as evidence his sister's letter, id. Paul Hilken Exhibit No. 4, p. 147, and a second letter from his sister as id. Paul Hilken Exhibit No. 5, p. 148. 25</p>

<p>These letters, the first undated, and the second dated March 20, 1931, show the anxiety of Hilken's family over the publicity resulting from the Sutherland articles. In the first, his sister, Nina, after expressing her opinion that the attempt to reopen the case would fail, said: '' Anyway don't you ever again let them persuade or frighten you into talking. They promised you no publicity — then took no steps to prevent the Germans and Belgians from letting in the mob * * *. That [conduct of the firm of lawyers] is contrary to the ethics of the profession. You can and must defy any attempt to make you a witness. * * * you lay low and say nothing." (Ex. 976, Ann. E, Paul Hilken Ex. No. 4.) (Emphasis in original.) In the second letter she uses this language : " Thanks for your last letter — with ' Liberty ' enclosure. I have bought every issue since — and notice with grief that your name appeared in the last number — and I 'm afraid the next numbers will have more. It's too bad. The only course to take now is to act as though you and we never read Liberty — and had no connection with that particular Paul H. ! — Or, with those people who know too much, that you were acting according to instructions from the North G. Lloyd — and did not know what you were contracting for. * * * It 's too bad for Henry and the girls — because they will worry. If worst comes to worst, they '11 just have to move away from Baltimore. In a strange city no one would remember the name." (Ex. 976, Ann. E, Paul Hilken Ex. No. 5.) (14) Hilken rediscovers the message Christmas, 1930, and delivers same to Mr. Peto April 27, 1931 Hilken claimed to have rediscovered the Blue Book message in his attic Christ- mas, 1930, and he brought the message to Mr. Peto on April 27, 1931 (Ex. 976, Ann. E, p. 151 ; Ex. 904(3), executed May 8th, 1931). (15) Hilken's claim of rediscovery substantiated by his wife and daughter Hilken's claim that he rediscovered the Blue Book in his attic Christmas, 1930, is substantiated by the affidavits of his estranged wife and of his daughter. In her affidavit of November 15, 1932 (Ex. 972), Mrs. Hilken referred to the visit paid to her home by Mr. Harold H. Martin, counsel of the American Agent, on December 15, 1931, said visit having been described by Mr. Martin in Exhibit 911, dated May 26, 1932, filed May 27, 1932. The object of this visit was to secure Hilken's 1916 diary. In Exhibit 911 Mr. Martin recited a visit paid by himself and Mr. Hilken to the home of Hilken's estranged wife on December 9, 1931, for the purpose of locating the diary. Following this visit, Mrs. Hilken made a search in the attic and finally on Saturday, December 12th, found the diary in a doll's trunk; and, on the succeeding visit of Mr. Martin on December 15th, she turned the diary over to him. In Exhibit 972 Mrs. Hilken relates the details of Mr. Martin's visit. She states that Exhibit 911 conformed to her recollection of what passed between them and then she states : " I remember the lad Raoul, who was an unwelcome guest at my home for two or three days. He spoke practically no English; smoked cigarettes incessantly, and amused himself with our pianoplayer. " I am aware of the fact that my husband, Paul G. L. Hilken, has delivered to representatives of the United States, the Blue Book Magazine which this lad Raoul brought from Mexico in 1917. I know that my husband discovered this</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>375 magazine and other papers in the attic of my home at Christmas, 1930. Although my husband did not tell me personally what this magazine contained, he did tell my daughter, Theodora, that it contained a message written in lemon juice, and that names were pin-pricked out in the printed matter on various pages in the magazine. " This statement is made at the request of the Agent of the United States, in confirmation of similar statements made verbally to Mr. Leonard A. Peto by my daughter Theodora and by me, a year or so ago." Appended to Mrs. Hilken's affidavit is the affidavit of her daughter, Theodora St. Vincent Hilken, which reads as follows: " I have read the above statement by my mother, and hereby confirm that my father, Paul G. L. Hilken, found a magazine containing a message, written partly in lemon juice and partly by pin pricks, at our home in Baltimore on Christmas Day, 1930." (16) Hilken substantiated by Can and Cooney In Exhibit 976, Ann. L, dated April 22, 1933, filed September 15, 1933, Frank Carr, an employee of the Thiel Service Company, testified that on Monday, April 20, 1931, he was assigned by T. J. Cooney to locate a certain man named Maubach, living at 40 West 89th Street, New York City, and was accompanied by Fred Herrmann. After abandoning the work for the day, he went with Herrmann to 135 West 183rd Street where Hilken resided, and they talked with Hilken about Herrmann's visit to Mexico. Hilken produced a demi- john of home-made wine and before they left the apartment it had been prac- tically all consumed. During the evening Hilken and Herrmann discussed the sabotage cases and various people concerned therewith, and Herrmann boasted that they could have proven the case for the Lehigh Valley railroad, but they would not do anything for Arnold and Peaslee. Then the affidavit goes on as follows : " Herrmann said to Hilken, ' You can produce your 1916 diary, and Hilken said, ' Yes, I can.' He also said, ' I have go[t] something better than that, which would clear up both the Canadian Car &amp; Foundry case and Black Tom.' Herrmann said, ' What's that? ' and Hilken replied, ' I still have that book you sent me, in which there were messages written.' Herrmann became excited and they conversed in German, which I do not understand." He stated that both Hilken and Herrmann were incensed with Mr. Peaslee over the Liberty articles and with Mr. Arnold about some remark he had made about putting pressure on Herrmann to make him reveal more about Black Tom. In Exhibit 976, Annex M, Cooney, after reading the statement of Carr, testified as follows: " The next day after Carr and Herrmann's visit to Hilken's apartment, Herrmann called at my office at 50 Church Street and I asked him what the book was he and Hilken had been discussing in the presence of Carr the previous evening as Mr. Carr had reported it to me. Herrmann stated this book was a magazine he had sent back by messenger from Mexico to Hilken; that there was a message written in invisible ink in this magazine, in which he asked Hilken to send him some money and also to advise some German officials in Mexico that he was one of their agents. He stated he also mentioned Wozniak in the message and that the messages in this magazine would undoubtedly show the connection of the German agents with both Black Tom and Kingsland. Herrmann stated that Hilken had said that the magazine had remained hidden away some place in Baltimore and he had found it on his last visit to Baltimore. " I reported this to Mr. Peto immediately and took occasion to urge Herrmann personally to endeavor to persuade Hilken to deliver this document to the Claimants. Herrmann said that he would do so, but that Hilken was scared about Black Tom."</p>

<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(17)</span><p>Hilken substantiated by Mrs. Elizabeth Braun</p></div>
<p>In Exhibit 974, Elizabeth Braun, a resident of New York City, testified under date of November 12, 1932, that she had known Mr. Hilken and the members of his family for a number of years; that on the first Sunday following Christmas, 1930, Hilken was a guest at her home for dinner, and, while discussing the visit of Hilken to Baltimore on Christmas Day: " Mr. Hilken told me about having located in the attic of his old home in Roland Park a number of old papers concerning his activities during the period of the late war, and mentioned one particular document, which he said was of great importance, consisting of a magazine which Fred Herrmann had sent to him from Mexico in 1917, and which contained a secret meassge written therein by Mr. Herrmann in lemon juice, and which writing had been made visible by Mr. Hilken through the application to it of a hot iron. " Mr. Hilken explained that the names in the message were pin-pricked on various pages in the magazine. " In making this statement as to the time when Mr. Hilken told me as to this document, I am repeating exactly what I told to Mr. Leonard A. Peto and others about a year and a half ago shortly after Mr. Hilken turned over that particular document as evidence to be submitted to the Mixed Claims Commission." (18) Hilken's efforts to show the message to the Umpire Hilken's explanation of the delay in the production of the magazine from Christmas, 1930, until April 27, 1931, was the publicity given by the Liberty Magazine articles, his interviews with Rintelen, and the attitude of his family. It was also explained by him, however, that in the latter part of February, 1931, he took the Blue Book to Umpire Boyden's office. He was afraid that Mr. Bonynge. the American Agent, would get in touch with the claimants and the attorneys and there would be more publicity and, therefore, he made a personal effort to see Mr. Boyden and present the magazine to him in Boston (Ex. 976, Ann. E, p. 152). Before doing this, he telephoned to a friend of his, a Miss Phillips, and asked her to communicate with Boyden's office and find out when he would be in town. He received a telegram from Miss Phillips that Boyden would be in New Hampshire the early part of the week and would be in his office on Friday, February the 27th. He therefore went to Boston by boat the night of the 26th and called at Mr. Boyden's office on the 27th, where his secre- tary, Miss Smyth, informed Hilken that Boyden had unexpectedly been called to New York and gave Hilken his address as 44 Broad Street, cjo Mr. Searle. He explained to Miss Smyth exactly what he had with him and told her to explain to Boyden the reason for his visit. Hilken then called on his friend, Charles Curry, who knew the President of the First National Bank of which Umpire Boyden was a director, and Curry offered to arrange a meeting with Boyden if Hilken was unsuccessful in seeing him in New York (id. p. 154). (19) Hilken's efforts to see Boyden confirmed The fact that Hilken did endeavor to see Boyden is further confirmed by the affidavit of J. Henry Phillips (Ex. 976, Ann. K). From this affidavit it appears that Hilken was a friend of the Phillips family while he was a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he had the nickname of " Bis- marck". Phillips was the brother of Adelaide Phillips, who wrote the letter filed with Ex. 976, Ann. E, as Ex. 6, and who died on April 27, 1932. By a reference to his sister's diary, he found that Paul Hilken was in Boston on February 27, 1931, and he testified that his sister, Adelaide, had received a letter</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>377 from Hilken asking her to inquire from the office of the Umpire when he would be in his office, and his sister told him that Mr. Boyden was expected on February 27, 1931, and she either telegraphed or telephoned that information to Hilken in New York. (20) Hilken's effort to see Boyden confirmed by Miss Phillips Hilken's effort to see the Umpire is also confirmed by letter from Miss Adel- aide Phillips, dated February 28, 1931 (Paul Hilken Ex. 6, to Ex. 976, Ann. E). In this letter Miss Phillips uses the following language: " I have been thinking of you all the morning and wondering if you were with Mr. Boyden. I do hope that you saw him and accomplished all that you hoped to. If he sees you I feel you will be successful. * * * Please let me know how the Boyden incident ended. I hope you saw him and had a successful inter- view." (Emphasis in original.) (21) Hilken's effort to see Boyden by Curry Hilken's attempt to get in touch with Boyden is further corroborated by the affidavit of Charles H. Curry, the co-partner of Curry Brothers Oil Company, who had known Hilken intimately for about twelve years. He testified that Hilken called on him at his Boston office in the early part of the year 1931 to seek his assistance in obtaining an interview with the late Roland Boyden. Hilken related to him in a general way his testimony before the Mixed Claims Commission, and was incensed that he should have been disbelieved and ignor- ed and classified as a liar, and also on account of the distress caused to his family by the undesirable publicity. Hilken asked Curry to arrange a meeting with Mr. Boyden in order that he might prove with letters and documents which he had with him that his testimony was true and Curry consented to do this as he had confidence in Hilken's integrity (Ex. 976, Ann. J). (22) Hilken's visit to the Umpire's office is confirmed by the Umpire's Secretaiy Hilken's visit to Boyden's office is further confirmed by the affidavit of Grace K. Smyth, Boyden's secretary, who testified that " during the early part of 1931, the exact date I am now unable to recall, Mr. Paul G. L. Hilken called and inquired for Mr. Boyden ". Hilken explained to her that he had been called as a witness before the Mixed Claims Commission and was incensed at having been called a liar in the decision rendered by the Commission, and he was seeking an opportunity " to prove to Mr. Boyden by exhibiting corroborative documents, that his testimony was true"". She gave Hilken Boyden's address in New York where she thought Boyden could be reached (Ex. 976, Ann. I).</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-5"><span class="para-num">5.</span><p>The Internal Evidence A careful analysis of the Herrmann message discloses that it had at least seven purposes : (1) To enlist Hilken's aid in convincing von Eckardt, the German Minister to Mexico, of Herrmann's bona fides, and his mission in Mexico. (2) To persuade Hilken to send Herrmann 525,000. (3) To persuade Hinsch and Hilken to leave the States and come to Mexico, or, in the case of Hilken, to go to South America. (4) In connection with Hinsch to promote the destruction of enemy commerce on the West Coast.</p></div>

<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(5)</span><p>To warn Hilken where he might expect trouble from co-saboteurs and</p></div>
<p>their friends. (6) To awaken memories of past sabotage acts. (7) " Bearer will relate experiences and details." An effort will be made to study the record to ascertain, if possible, whether the purposes above set out were the normal reaction of Herrmann at the time when he sent the message by Gerdts to Hilken, or whether these purposes, clearly disclosed in the Blue Book message, were a part of a clever scheme to use the facts already in the record to convince the Commission by a forged instrument that the confessions of Herrmann and Hilken were genuine. We will now take up each of the aforesaid purposes in their order. (/) To enlist Hilken's aid in convincing von Eckardt, the German Minister to Mexico, oj Herrmann's bona fides, and his mission in Mexiio The sentences in the message used for this purpose are as follows: " Have seen Eckardt he is suspicious of me Can't convince him I come from Marguerre and Nadolny Have told him all reference Hinsch and I Deutschland, Jersey City Terminal, Kings- land, Savannah, and Tonys Lab he doubts me on account of my bum German Confirm to him thru your channels all OK and my mission here ". The prevailing thought and purpose in the sentences quoted above is to remove from Eckardt's mind the suspicions which he entertained in regard to Herrmann. Several times in this opinion we have had occasion to refer to two telegrams that passed between von Eckardt in Mexico and Marguerre and Nadolny, in charge of" Sektion Politik ", just after America entered the war (Ex. 520, Rec. p. 1847; Ex. 320, Rec. p. 874 — See supra, this Opinion, p. 34). t The first telegram is dated April 13, 1917, and contains a message, dated April 12, 1917, which was sent by Herrmann to Captain Marguerre or Nadolny, General Staff. The first telegram, containing Herrmann's telegram, reads as follows in the translation furnished by the German Agent (Ann. 21 to Report. ofGer. Agent of 8/1/29): Marguerre " 17 April 12 [For Captain Magea or Nadolny, General Staff: ' Mexico, April 12. Where is Lieutenant Whost? Has he remitted about 525,000 to Paul Hilken? Either he or somebody else should send me money Fritz Quarts en Hermann.' " Referring to preceding paragraph. Hermann (slender, fair, German with American accent) claims to have received a year ago order from General Staff and again last January from Hilken to set fire to Tampico oil fields and wants to put plan into execution now. He asks me if he should do it; am I not to answer that I have no contact with Berlin? Mr. von Verdy suspects him and his com- panion Raoul Gerds to be America-English spies. I request telegraphic answer, rush.] * * * * * * * von Eckardt.</p>

<p>Note by the Secretariat, this volume, pp. 262-263.</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">DÉCISIONS</h3>
<p>379 The reply to von Eckardt's telegram was sent on May 13, 1917, and reads as follows : " Hermann's statements are correct. Nothing is known of Gerds. Wohst has been retired. " The firing of Tampico would be valuable from a military point of view, but the General Staff leaves it to you to decide. " Please do not sanction anything which would endanger our relations with Mexico or if the question arises, give Hermann any open support. • * + * * * • " (Ex. 320, Rec. p. 874). A careful analysis of these two telegTams shows clearly that on April 12, 1917, six days after America entered the war, Herrmann, the next day after his arrival in Mexico City, called on the German Minister in Mexico, von Eckardt, asking for money, and that he also informed the Minister that he had received from the General Staff a year ago an order, which had been renewed in January by Hilken, to set fire to the Tampico oil fields and now proposed to carry it out and wanted the Minister to sanction his plan. The minister was not certain whether Herrmann and Gerdts, his companion, were German agents and could be trusted, and recited to Marguerre and Nadol- ny of the General Staff that Verdy believed them to be American or English spies; and he suggested to the General Staff that it might be well for him (Eckardt) to deny that he was in touch with Berlin. The General Staff's answer of the 13th of May confirmed in every respect Herrmann's statement, particularly as to his commission to set fire to the Tampi- co oil fields, but the matter of firing the Tampico oil fields was left to the German Minister to decide; but the Minister was warned not openly to support Herrmann. The first telegram which had been sent by von Eckardt a few days before Gerdts left Mexico for Baltimore, confirms in every respect the recitals in the message set out above. As no reply was forwarded from Berlin to von Eckardt's query until the 13th day of May, it is clear that von Eckardt's suspicions had not been removed when the Herrmann message was written and forwarded to Baltimore. We know from the intercepted messages that, when Hinsch finally arrived in Mexico, a contest immediately started between Jahnke on the one side and Hinsch on the other, and later participated in by Dilger, as to whether Hinsch or Jahnke should be the recognized leader of saboteurs in Mexico. We also know that von Eckardt was inclined to continue the commission 1 in Jahnke's hands and at one time asked leave of Berlin to dismiss Dilger and Hinsch. There- fore, the difficulties which Herrmann encountered in his first interview with von Eckardt were reflected in the difficulties encountered by Hinsch upon his arrival in Mexico (See, supra, this Opinion, pp. Ill et seq.). u The importance to Herrmann of securing the confidence of von Eckardt and of removing from von Eckardt's mind the suspicions which he entertained towards Herrmann cannot be overestimated : for, if Herrmann was to continue his sabotage activities in Mexico, it was necessary for him to secure von Eckardt's approval, as is shown by the telegram which the General Staff forwarded to von Eckardt, giving him the power of veto over Herrmann's activities in Mexico, including the firing of the Tampico oil fields. 1 This commission had been given by Wunnenberg, the dynamiter, and the " son Charles " of the cables of November 12, 1917 (Ex. 320, p. 879) and of April 3, 1918 (id. p. 906). Wunnenberg in turn received his commission from Wilhelm of the German Admiralty Staff of Antwerp (Ger. Ex. IV, pp. 7 et seq., and Ger. Ex. XXIX, pp. 3 et seq.). u Note by the Secretariat, this volume, pp. 317 et seq.</p>

<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>Von Eckardt seems to have occupied a more important position with reference to sabotage in Mexico than Hilken occupied in the United States. Yon Eckardt was both paymaster and director of the saboteurs, with power to veto their activities. It was not only necessary for Herrmann to secure von Eckardt's approval, but it would probably be impossible for Herrmann to finance his schemes unless he could secure, through von Eckardt, the necessary funds. Herrmann realized that, with the United States at war, it would be difficult for him to continue to receive funds from Hilken in the United States, and, therefore, his first aim, naturally, was to establish cordial relations between himself and the German Minister, and his appeal to Hilken for aid was the natural and normal thing to do. " Have told him all reference Hinsch and I Deutschland, Jersey City Terminal, Kingsland, Savannah and Tonys Lab [and yet] He doubts me on account of my bum German ". From Herrmann's point of view, here are enumerated sufficient references to Herrmann's connections with sabotage to have given von Eckardt confidence in him. Herrmann and Hinsch were the acknowledged leaders of sabotage in the United States. Of all the numerous plants destroyed, the devastating catas- trophes at Jersey City Terminal (Black Tom) and Kingsland had received most notoriety: Savannah was fresh in Herrmann's mind and it was natural for him to link it with the others. Tony's Lab referred, of course, to the fact that Anton Dilger had established in Chevy Chase, D.C., a laboratory for culture of disease germs to be used in inoculating with disease animals in the United States. Herrmann and Carl Dilger and Ahrendt had been used by Hinsch to distribute these germs to his force of men, who frequented, for this ignoble form of sabotage, the grounds used for assembling the animals — in Norfolk, Newport News, Baltimore, New York, and St. Louis. The fact that Herrmann used the term "Jersey City Terminal ", which was not in the record in 1931, instead of "Black Tom ", which was scattered all through the record, is certainly an argument in favor of the proposition that the Blue Book message was composed in 1917, rather than in 1931 ; for if the purpose of the composer of the message had been to make the message conform to the record as it was in 1931, he would certainly have selected " Black Tom " rather than " Jersey City Terminal ". So, also, instead of referring to " Tony's Lab ", he would have selected " Dilger's laboratory ", or " Delmar's Germs ", to make his message conform to the record as it stood in 1931. " he doubts me on account of my bum German ". In von Eckardt's telegram he described Herrmann as " slender fair, German with American accent " ; and he also recites that " Mr. von Verdy suspects him and his companion, Raoul Gerdts to be America-English spies." (2) To persuade Hilken to tend Herrmann $25,000 The sentences in the message used for this purpose are as follows: " I have no funds Eckhardt claims he is short of money Send by bearer U. S. 25000.— Have you heard from Willie Have wired Hildegard but no answer * * * * * * * Most important send funds."</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>381 These sentences indicate, first, that Herrmann had no funds; second, that he had applied to von Eckardt for money, but that von Eckardt had refused and claimed that he was short of money; third, that Herrmann's expectation of receiving $25,000 from Willie Woehst had not been realized and that his wire from Havana to Willie Woehst's cousin, Hildegarde Jacobsen, had not been productive of results and he had received no answer from her. Von Eckardt evidently did not convince Herrmann that he was dealing frankly; for in the message, Herrman tells Hilken: " Eckhardt claims he is short of money "; so that their suspicions were mutual. That Herrmann had good ground to be distrustful of von Eckardt is borne out by the latter's suggestion in his telegram to the General Staff: " * * * am I not to answer [Herrmann] that I have no contact with Berlin? " From Kaba's contemporaneous report (Ann. Y to Ex. 583, Rec. p. 2410 et seq.), it appears that Wilhelm Woehst in May, 1917, a little over a month after America entered the war, had been the subject of investigation by the Depart- ment of Justice. During this investigation, his cousin, Mary Hildegarde Jacob- sen, was examined. It was ascertained from her that Herrmann was at the time of the investigation in Mexico, that she received a cable from Herrmann about a month ago (end of March or early in April, 1917) from Cuba reading " Have you heard from Willie? "; and about two weeks prior to the report that she had a telegram from Herrmann sent, according to the report of her statement, from Havana reading " Have you seen Raoul ". As to this latter telegram, we know that either Miss Jacobsen or the examiner made a mistake; for the actual telegram was sent from Mexico dated May 6, 1917, and read as follows: " Have you seen Raoul. Answer immediately Hotel Juarez greetings (Ex. 587, Rec. p. 2478). F.March" In Kaba's report (Rec. p. 2414) Raoul (Gerdts) is represented as having been told by Herrmann that Miss Jacobsen was to receive $250,000, and that, in answer to the telegram of May 6, 1917, she had replied as follows: " I have seen Raoul. He left. No money." Evidently the sum $250,000, contained in Kaba's report was a mistake and should have read $25,000. This reply telegram instead of being sent to Hotel Juarez, Mexico City, was sent to the town of Juarez in Mexico and, therefore, was probably never received by Herrmann (Ex. 583, Ann. Y, Rec. p. 2414; Ex. 587, Rec. p. 2478). In the Kaba report referred to above (Ann. Y to Ex. 583, Rec. p. 2410 et seq.) Hildegarde Jacobsen reported that, on the day that Woehst returned to Ger- many, Herrmann told her she would receive a large sum of money from Willie Woehst, which she should deposit in bank until called for by him or Gerdts, and she was to explain the receipt of this money by stating that it had been left to her by a deceased relative in Germany (Rec. p. 2413). This report, made within two months after the United States entered the war, confirms the telegram sent by von Eckardt for Herrmann and also the message, in showing that Herrmann was expecting to receive money from Woehst. We have already seen that in his testimony under subpoena in September, 1933, Hilken explained the " A.C.D. " account on the books of the Eastern</p>
<p>382</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>Forwarding Company, aggregating $95,000, as representing amounts trans- ferred to Anton Dilger after he got to Mexico (Ex. 976, Ann. E, pp. 44-46). Hilken further testified that he did not remember the exact amounts he sent to Mexico, " but it was probably in the neighborhood of two or three hundred thousand that eventually went to Mexico * * * to get them [the saboteurs] out of this country, and also to finance Herrmann, Dilger and Hinsch, who had then gone to Mexico ". (id. pp. 45, 46) Some of this money was sent before and some after the United States had entered the war (id. p. 46) (See supra, this Opinion, p. 153). T Thus, a careful study of the record in regard to the money which Herrmann expected to receive reveals the fact that the message was a product of what he knew in 1917, and had a right to expect at that time. (3) To persuade Hinsch and Hilken to leave the States and come to Mexico, or, in the case of Hilken, to go to South America The sentences in the message used for this purpose are as follows: " Where are Hinsch and Carl Ahrendt Tell Hinsch to come here I expect to go north but he can locate me thru Eckhardt What will you do now with America in the war Are you coining here or going to South America Advise you drop everything and and leave the States " Hinsch and Herrmann had been so closely associated in their sabotage work that it was natural for Herrmann to desire the continuance of their relations. The desire to have Hinsch come to Mexico was also coupled with his scheme to promote the destruction of enemy commerce on the West Coast by the use of an old cruiser. As Hinsch had acted as Captain of the " Neckar " and had been likewise connected with the " U-Deutschland " activities, it was natural and normal for Herrmann to think that Mexico would offer a good field for Hinsch's experience. Herrmann's advice to Hilken to " drop everything and leave the States " showed Herrmann's natural anxiety to have his associates in sabotage cooperate with him in Mexico. At the time the message was despatched none of these associates had come to Mexico. Hinsch had not yet arrived. Anton Dilger was in Europe and did not reach Mexico until late July or early in August, 1917. After his return from Europe in 1916, Carl Dilger never left the United States but ceased sabotage work before America entered the war.1 Witzke in September, 1919, is reported by Tunney of Military Intelligence as saying that " in the early part of 1917 (Feb.) * * *, I left the United States for Mexico * * *" and was in Tampico " the latter part of May 1917 " investigating " a case that was reported to us of American and English Secret Service men trying to blow up an oil property or conspiring to blow up oil property in Tampico for the purpose of blaming the matter on German v Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 346. 1 Herrmann was also anxious to get his co-saboteurs out of the United States, because he was not sure of their discretion or their loyalty, as indicated by this sentence: " See that Hinsch brings with him all who might implicate us."</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>383 agents " (Ex. 24, Rec. pp. 68, 69). In his affidavit of July 19, 1927, Witzke, however, claims that "on March 23, 1917, * * * I signed on in San Francisco as a sailor on the steamer ' San Pedro ', on which I reached Manzinillo in April 1917 ". He then claims to have gone to Mexico City, where he " received a few commissions for observing movements of ships and the export of oil from Tampico and Vera Cruz " (Ger. Ex. Q,, p. 4). Jahnke claims to have gone to Mexico " in May 1917 " (Ger. Ex. P, p. 4). Schulenburg did not get to Mexico until the middle of August (Ex. 986, Ann. A, pp. 185, 186). We have already had occasion to examine the Arnold correspondence (supra, this Opinion, pp. 143 et seg.).'" In the course of that correspondence Arnold, in Havana, wrote Hilken suggesting that they go together to South America. Hilken on August 7, 1916, cabled Arnold expressing his regret at not being able to meet him and stating that he would send a trustworthy representative (Herr- mann) if Arnold thought it advisable (Ex. 906, Anns. V, W, X, Y, Z, AA, BB, 1; Ex. 42 attached to Ex. 976, Anns. A-D). Doubtless Herrmann was thoroughly familiar with these plans and, therefore, in urging Hilken and Hinsch to leave the States, he must have known that, in case Hilken did leave, he would consider going either to Mexico or to South America to join Arnold. (4) In connection with Hinsch to promote the destruction oj enemy commerce on the West Coast The sentences in the message used for this purpose are as follows: " tell him [Hinsch] Siegel is with me Tell Hinsch his plan OK Am in close touch with Major [Schwierz?] and influential Mexicans Can obtain old cruiser for 50000 West Coast." Although Siegel denied that he ever met Hilken or Hinsch in the United States (Ger. Ann. 134, Ger. Ann. 169), it is a remarkable fact that on September 18, 1919, more than two years before the Treaty of Berlin was ratified and nearly three years before the Mixed Claims Commission was brought into exist- ence by the Agreement of August 10, 1922, Captain Thomas J. Tunney, Special Investigator, United States Military Intelligence Division, reported that Witzke, a secret German agent in Mexico (who had been convicted of espionage), had voluntarily made a statement to him, from which it appeared that Siegel operated in the early part of the year 1916 in the City of New York under the supervision of a Captain of the North German-Lloyd Steamship Company, who " was in charge of the tug-boat that took in the Submarine Deutschland in Baltimore on the first trip " (Ex. 24, Rec. p. 93). He afterwards stated that the Captain referred to was Hinsch (id. p. 94). If Witzke's report to Tunney be correct, namely, that Siegel was operating under Hinsch in New York in 1916, it was natural for Herrmann, in Mexico, to inform Hilken that Siegel was with him. When Hilken was under examination by Mr. Sobeloff, the United States District Attorney at Baltimore, taken in accordance with Act of June 7, 1933 (48 Stat. 117), the following questions and answers occurred (Ex. 976, Ann. E, p. 138): Note by the Secretariat, this volume, pp. 339 et seq.</p>
<p>384</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>" Q,. Mr. Hilken, the message says, ' Tell him (that is Hinsch) Siegel is with me.' And yet both Siegel and Hinsch testified in this case that they did not know each other at that time. " A. There is nothing inconsistent in that because I had met Siegel at the McAlpin, and Fritz was simply letting me know that Siegel was down there, so as to indicate to Hinsch that he could count on additional help. " Q_. Do you know whether Hinsch had ever met Siegel? " A. No, I do not. But I knew Siegel. I knew he had come from China or Russia, and had appeared to me as a most efficient and capable man." The fact that Siegel stayed at Hotel McAlpin is confirmed by his affidavit of November 12, 1937 (Ger. Ann. 134), where he said that, when he arrived at New York on his trip from China, he stayed for a few days at the Hotel Mc- Alpin. The insertion of Siegel's name in the message was probably due to the fact that Siegel was present when the message was being composed, and Herrmann wanted to incorporate his name for that reason. Certainly from the standpoint of a person who was fabricating the message in 1931, the insertion of Siegel's name would not have added any strength to his fabrication, for it is clear that Hilken himself had forgotten that he ever met Siegel (Ex. 583, Rec. pp. 2239- 2242). The mention of Siegel's name in the message added no verity to the message, and, like the mention of Wolfgang and Phil Wirth, is one of the circumstances tending to show that the message was not concocted as a clever scheme to deceive the Commission by conforming with the record. In Gerdts' first affidavit (Ex. 626 (a) Rec. p. 2773) he told of going to Hilken's home in Roland Park and finding Hilken, to whom he gave the page from the book of poetry. Hilken then went to the cellar to decipher the order and told Gerdts he did not have that amount of money (825,000) " but I should stay at his home while he went to New York to procure the money." Gerdts remained in his home three days, during which time Hilken went to New London and brought Hinsch back with him, and Hilken told Gerdts that he was going to send the money by another friend. Shortly after that Captain Hinsch was introduced to Gerdts, and Hinsch told him to go back to Mexico and gave him $1,000, and also told him that he was going to bring the balance of $24,000 himself. Thereupon Gerdts said: " He asked me to tell Hermann that he (Hinsch) was busily engaged in getting guns of 7.05 millimeters across the border into Mexico which were to be used to equip a destroyer in Mazatlan, intercepting ships carrying cargoes from San Francisco. He told me to tell Hermann to enlist the two hundred men that were required to man the destroyer, which Hinsch himself was to command." In Hinsch's affidavit of June 28, 1932, relating the same incidents (Ger. Ann. 71), Hinsch first tells the circumstances under which he went on Sunday to dinner at Hilken's home in Roland Park, describes the message as a very short one consisting of an identification of Gerdts, a request for money and advice that Gerdts would report verbally about all other matters; and, in his affidavit as finally executed, he also stated that to up that time Gerdts was unknown to both him and Hilken; and he states the circumstances under which he formed the conclusion " that Gerdts had really come from Herrmann and was not, by any chance, an agent of the American Intelligence Service who had taken this book away from a messenger of Herrmann at the border." (p. 4)</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">DÉCISIONS</h3>
<p>385 He then repeated Gerdts' oral statement as follows (p.5) : " He mentioned first that Herrmann, down in Mexico, was very short of money and that he (Herrmann) had given him (Gerdts) half of his remaining funds so that he could make the trip to Baltimore. He then told us that Herrmann could not obtain any funds from Mr. von Eckardt, the German Minister in Mexico, since Mr. von Eckardt distrusted Herrmann. Herrmann, he said, had told Mr. von Eckardt of the U-DEUTSCHLAND expeditions and had mentioned Hilken's and my names to identify himself to Mr. von Eckardt. Mr. von Eckardt, however, he said, did not want to have anything to do with him. Gerdts told us, furthermore, that Herrmann was in Sonora and that he had become friends with one Major Schwieritz. Herrmann had found out, he said, that some German sailing vessels were lying in the harbor of Sonora and that he could hire a large enough crew to man an auxiliary cruiser; guns and ammunition could also be procured.</p>
<p>I should, therefore, come down to Mexico to take command of the auxiliary cruiser. We could then, with the aid of this auxiliary cruiser, capture enemy merchant vessels. Furthermore, Gerdts told us that Herrmann had instructed him to tell us that he had found out that there was a possibility of setting fire to oil wells near Tampico. Herrmann, he said, had made a suggestion to that effect to the German Minister. The latter, however, had forbidden Herrmann to undertake any such thing; consequently, Mr. von Eckardt did not want to have anything at all to do with Herrmann. At the end of his report Gerdts mentioned that Herrmann could be reached through the German Legation in Mexico and the German Consul in Sonora, Rademacher, whom he would inform of his whereabouts." It is remarkable how many of the statements attributed by Hinsch to Gerdts as oral information are found in the Blue Book message. Some of these will be examined below {infra, this Opinion, pp. 220, 221). x If the Herrmann message had been produced after Hinsch's affidavit, there would have been good grounds for suspecting that the draughtsman of the message had copied many statements vtrbaHm therefrom. On January 11, 1929, when Gerdts made his statement in Ex. 626 (a) Rec. p. 2773, there was, of course, no Blue Book message in the record and Gerdts was relating from memory incidents that had occurred twelve years before that time. An analysis and comparison of Gerdts' original affidavit (Ex. 626 (a), Rec. p. 277.3), Hinsch's report on the oral message delivered by Gerdts (Ger. Ann., 71, p. 5) and the contents of the message as found in the Blue Book of January 1917, disclose the fact that there are many points of similarity but also some striking differences. An examination of the record will disclose clearly that where Hinsch in his report of the oral message from Herrmann varied or changed the terms of the message as contained in the Blue Book or departed from Gerdts' original statement of January 11, 1929, it was Hinsch who was guilty of fabrica- tion and not Gerdts or Herrmann. Hinsch represents Gerdts as saying that Herrmann was in Sonora and had found out that some German sailing vessels were lying in the harbor of Sonora and that he could hire a large enough crew to man an auxiliary cruiser. Gerdts says in his statement of January 11, 1929, that he was directed by Hinsch to return to Mexico and tell Herrmann that Hinsch was busy making preparations for equipping a destroyer and that Herrmann should enlist two hundred men for that enterprise. We now know that Herrmann was not in Sonora and that he did not reach Sonora until some time in June (see report of Frederick Simpich, American Consul at Guaymas, Mexico, dated September 16, 1917, Ex. 583, Ann. AA, Rec. p. 2421 et seq.). From this paper it appears that Herrmann, with a false Note by the Secretarial, this volume, pp. 394, 395.</p>
<p>386</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>passport dated March 5, 1917, arrived in Sonora some time in June, 1917, that this passport was marked " Gesehen v. Eckart 21 Mai 17 " and with him were Siegel and Schwierz, a German who had become a major in the Mexican Army. In Ex. 986, Ann. A, p. 151, Herrmann was shown this passport and testified that the endorsement was placed thereon at the Embassy in Mexico City and from this he states that he could not have been in Sonora even on the 21st of May. He further testified that he went to Sonora about the beginning of June, after Gerdts got back to Mexico with about $700, and he gave him enough money for his return to his home in Colombia (id. pp. 152, 153), so that before Herr- mann went to Sonora Gerdts was on his way to Colombia. In Ex. 904 (4), affidavit of Herrmann, dated the 9th day of May, 1931, in speaking of Gerdts' return to Mexico he said : " As I remember the circumstances Gerdts returned to Mexico with only about $800 and told me that Hinsch was coming down and would bring the balance of the S25,000 which I requested. Hinsch finally arrived in Mexico City while I was on the North West Coast, and Rademacher told me that a wire had arrived from von Eckardt for me to return to Mexico City immediately." In Ex. 986, Ann. A, p. 153 et seq., Herrmann testified that it was improbable for Gerdts to have told Hinsch in Baltimore that he, Herrmann, was in Sonora. He said : " It would have been impossible for me to have been in Sonora, as the records II pr. ~ • - - - - - • - until all prove that I was in Mexico City the whole time, and did not leave Mexico City itil after I had sent Gerdts back to Colombia." When Hinsch's testimony, quoting Gerdts as saying that Herrmann was in Sonora at the time when Gerdts was with Hinsch and Hilken in Baltimore, was read to him, Herrmann said (id. p. 154) : " It must be clear to you from the records that you yourself have that Hinsch is deliberately trying to put me in Sonora at a time when I was actually in Mexico City so as to discredit my testimony about sending the message — either that or he is trying to discredit Gerdts." Then he asks the examiner this question: " Mr. Sobeloff, what does Gerdts say about that? " Q_. He testified in January, 1929, that you were in Mexico City in April, 1917, and that Hinsch sent him back to you to tell you to go to Sonora to recruit the men for the cruiser. " A. That is exactly true and what actually happened. " Q.. When Gerdts returned what information did he bring to you from Hinsch? " A. That Hinsch was coming down with some money and for me to go to Sonora, that he would get in touch with me there through Von Eckardt. " Q_. Did not you say that Gerdts brought you some money? " A. Only a little, somewhere around seven hundred dollars. " O_. How much were you awaiting? " A. I was expecting about $25,000. Gerdts only brought about S700. Hinsch told him he would bring the balance of the money with him. " Q_. Did you go to the West Coast with the money which Gerdts brought you? " A. That was not quite sufficient, after giving Raoul money to go back to Colombia, so I secured more money, I think two or three thousand pesos, from Von Eckardt. " Q. Did Von Eckardt receive an answer from Berlin to his cable before giving you the money?</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>387 " A. He told me he had and that everything was O. K., for me to report to Rademacher and keep in touch with him so he would always know where to get in touch with me. " Q,. The record shows that Von Eckhardt did not receive the cable from Berlin, in answer to his inquiry about you, until about the middle of May. " A. It was after that that he gave me the money and that I left for Sonora. * * * * * * * " Q_. About when did you get this notification that Hinsch was in Mexico City? " A. Somewhere towards the end of July, and I arrived in Mexico City early in August." And again on p. 157: " Q,- Was it after this date, July 17th, that you returned to Mexico City? " A. I returned shortly after that date. I have already stated that I arrived in Mexico City about the beginning of August." On p. 158, he was asked this question: " Q. What was the result of your trip to Sonora in connection with the cruiser? " A. When I returned to Mexico City and reported to Hinsch, Hinsch got cold feet and we dropped the entire matter." Therefore, when Hinsch represented in his affidavit (Ger. Ann. 71) that Gerdts said " that Herrmann was in Sonora " and that Herrmann " could hire a large enough crew to man an auxiliary cruiser ", it is not reasonable to believe that Gerdts made such a statement on April 30, 1917, because Gerdts had been with Herrmann ever since Herrmann arrived in Mexico and he knew that Herrmann had not been in Sonora. Herrmann did not reach Sonora for about two months thereafter; and when Hinsch claims to have directed Gerdts " to tell Herrmann to remain in Sonora until he should hear from me and that until then he should not undertake anything in these matters ", Hinsch was guilty of pure invention and fabrication, by taking the data in Gerdts' affidavit and varying the same for the purpose of contradicting the message. The object of Herrmann's trip to Sonora and of his activities there, as reported by Simpich, was clearly to carry out the instructions Gerdts said he brought from Hinsch in regard to manning the destroyer. Likewise, Hinsch's grounds for vetoing the scheme of the auxiliary cruiser as impracticable, because they would need the requisition by a battleship com- mander, was just as fanciful. It was probably the fear of the navies of the United States and Great Britain, and not the lack of requisition of a battleship commander, that put the veto on this scheme. This is confirmed by Herrmann who in giving the results of his trip to Sonora in connection with the cruiser, said that when he returned to Mexico City and reported to Hinsch, " Hinsch got cold feet " and the entire matter was dropped (Ex. 986, Ann. A, p. 158). Hilken testified that the reference in the message to engaging a cruiser referred to a discussion between Hinsch, Herrmann and himself before Herr- mann left the United States and he stated : " Hinsch had the idea that he would start out from Mexico soon'after his arrival there as a commerce raider. His thought was he would be a second Count Luchner.'* (Ex. 976, Ann. E, p. 137.) (5) To warn Hilken where he might expect trouble from co-saboteurs and their jriendx The sentences in the message used for this purpose are as follows : " Be careful of her [Hildegarde Jacobsen] and connections</p>
<p>388</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>I dont trust Carl Ahrendt, Kristoff, Wolfgang, and that Hoboken bunch If cornered they might get us in Dutch with authorities See that Hinsch brings with him all who might implicate us Where is Carl D[ilger] he worries me remember past experience Has Hinsch seen Wozniak Tell him to fix that up If you have any difficulties see Phil Wirth Nat Arts Club." The reason for Herrmann's distrust of Hildegarde Jacobsen, Willie Woehst's first cousin, is not disclosed in the record; but as a matter of fact we know that in May, 1917, she did disclose to the Department of Justice many facts which raised suspicions as to the activities of Woehst, Herrmann and Hilken. The haste with which Woehst and Herrmann left their apartment in New York, with compromising papers therein, was probably because they became aware that the Department of Justice was on their trail, and it may be that Herrmann had reason to suspect Hildegarde Jacobsen of being responsible. Just why Herrmann distrusted " Carl Ahrendt, Kristoff, Wolfgang, and that Hoboken bunch " is not clear from the record. It is clear from the record, however, that Ahrendt did not hesitate to fabricate evidence. Wolfgang is unknown, and " that Hoboken bunch " evidently refers to the German interned sailors who were used by Rintelen and Hinsch in their worst forms of incendiary sabotage and inoculating animals. " Where is Carl D[ilger] he worries me remember past experience " The anxiety which Herrmann here expresses as to Carl Dilger is thoroughly reflected in the record and has been carefully studied and analyzed in this Opinion (supra, pp. 95 et seq.). y The story was first told by Herrmann on April 3rd, 1930 (Rec. pp. 5431, 5489), and was subsequently confirmed by Hinsch in German Exhibit CXXVIII, p. 108, and was also confirmed by the production of Hilken's contemporary correspondence with Captain W. Bartling, German Commercial Attaché at Copenhagen (Ex. 906, Anns. A and D) and with Mr. Haguested (Ex. 906, Anns. O and P). It was also confirmed by Carl Dilger (Ex. 764, Rec. p. 5649) who gave his affidavit on April 18, 1930, about eight months before the message was rediscovered by Hilken in his attic and one year before it was produced. " Has Hinsch seen Wozniak Tell him to fix that up " In Herrmann's confession of April 3, 1930 (Rec. p. 5431 et seq.), Herrmann told about his employment of Wozniak and Rodriguez and of giving them incendiary pencils in December, 1916, or January, 1917 (id. pp. 5433-5455, 5503 - 5505). He showed them how to work the pencils, and, two days after the fire, he met Rodriguez and gave him $500 and two or three days afterwards he saw Hinsch at New London (id. pp. 5455, 5503 - 5505). But he never saw Wozniak after that (p. 5456). In the same deposition, on re-examination by the American Agent, he again tells of giving the tubes to Wozniak and Rodri- guez several days before the Kingsland fire and paying them $40 a week for y Note by the Secretariat, this volume, pp. 306 et seq.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>389 three or four weeks and after the fire he paid Rodriguez 55500 but he never saw Wozniak again (id. p. 5588). That Herrmann had almost an instinctive dislike and distrust of Wozniak is clearly established by the record. Thus, before the production of the message, Herrmann, under an examination by the German Agent, repeated a conver- sation he had with Hinsch about Wozniak, as follows : " I don't like the looks of this fellow [Wozniak]. He looks as if he is half crazy. I don't know whether to believe him, * * * or if he can do anything or not." (Rec. p. 5502.) And then, again, when he was informed that Wozniak was in Mexico, he said : " Of course I did not want to see him, because he was half cuckoo. I thought perhaps he was sore because he did not get his money, and I thought maybe he would take a shot out of me." (Id. p. 5460.) And, again, under examination by the German Agent, Herrmann testified as follows (id. p. 5528) : " You were not inclined to give him anything? A. Who, Wozniak? " Q.. Yes. A. No. " O_. Why not? A. I was sort of scared of that guy. " Q,. Were you willing to pay him? A. If I had met him shortly after the fire I would have paid him. " O_. But afterward you did not think it necessary? A. Afterwards I didn't want to. He did the job, and that was enough for me. " O_. He did what? A. After he did the job that was enough for me. I didn't want to see him again. Why? If I was to have got going with him I would have had him hanging on my neck for the next couple of years, and if I didn't take care of him more and more he would threaten to squeal on me." " If you have any difficulties see Phil Wirth Nat Arts Club " The name of Phil Wirth had not appeared in the record before the message was produced. After the message was produced Hilken was asked the question as to the significance of the above sentence and replied : " I don't know. I had never known Mr. Wirth. I believe he was a friend of Herrmann and that Herrmann wanted to give me his name and address so that I would have some one who could be of assistance to me in case of necessity. But that is only a surmise on my part." (Ex. 976, Ann. E, p. 138.) Herrmann, when asked the question: " Why did you make the reference in the message to Phil Wirth of the National Arts Club? " stated that he had met Wirth on board the steamer " New Amsterdam " after he had been put out of England in January, 1916; that he became better acquainted with him in New York and Wirth offered to help him in any way he possibly could, especially if Herrmann was to get into trouble, and told Herrmann to communicate with him and he would be only too glad to help him. When asked why he mentioned his name in the message, he said: " Because I thought most likely Paul would be in trouble at that time and that he did not know for sure whom he could trust. Wirth had also arranged cover addresses for me in Holland and Denmark, and I knew that Hilken could trust him." (Ex. 986, Ann. A, p. 184.) (6~) To awaken memories of sabotage acts The sentences in the message used for this purpose are as follows : " Regards to Hoppenburg Sei nicht dum mach doch wieder bumm bumm bumm." 26</p>
<p>390</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>The explosion at Black Tom was in the early morning of July 30th, 1916. Six days after that explosion, to-wit, on August 5th, Hinsch, Herrmann, Hoppen- berg, and Hilken were in the office of the Eastern Forwarding Company in the Whitehall Building with windows looking out over the Hudson River. Two or three windows had been cracked by the force of the explosion at Black Tom and at this meeting Hoppenberg facetiously pointed to the broken windows and said: " Why, you fellows have broken my windows." Herrmann retorted to Hoppenberg by singing a song of the war of 1870: " Lieber Moltke sei nicht dumm. Mach mal wieder, bumm, bumm, bumm" which being freely translated means : " Dear Moltke, don't be so dumb Go out rather and make bumm, bumm, bumm " (Ex. 976, Ann. E, p. 59.). (7) " Bearer will relate experiences and details. Greetings." The statement that " bearer will relate experiences and details " was a natural closing sentence for the message, having no specific relation to any other portion of the message or the record ; but this sentence was evidently the portion of the message which suggested to Hinsch that his description should include an oral message, much longer and much more in detail than the written message described by him. As to the last word " greetings ", this was the same salutation which was used by Herrmann in his telegram to Hildegarde Jacobsen dated May 6, 1917 (Ex. 587, Rec. p. 2478). It has been clearly established that Hinsch's attack on the Herrmann message failed (1) in claiming that, since Gerdts was unknown to Hilken (and Hinsch), its purpose was to identify Gerdts; (2) in claiming that, since lemon juice was an outmoded form of secret writing in 1916 and 1917, Herrmann would not have used lemon juice in a message to Hilken in early 1917; (3) in claiming that the border when Gerdts crossed it was being closely watched. It has been clearly established on the contrary (1) that Gerdts was well known to Hilken before he brought the Herrmann message; (2) that secret messages written in lemon juice were still being employed by German agents at the time the Herrmann message was drafted and Herrmann was expecting such messages when he left hurriedly for Cuba, en route to Mexico; (3) that Hinsch, himself, knew from personal experience that the border in April, 1917, was not being closely watched. In the examination of the internal evidence we have found other examples of an effort by Hinsch to fabricate evidence in order to detract from the verity of the message. If the message as produced by Hilken had been concocted for the purpose of convincing the Commission by fabricated evidence that German agents were responsible for the destruction of Black Tom and Kingsland, is it not strange that no anachronisms have been discovered and that no departures from facts established in the record have been brought forward? Attacks on the Herrmann Message</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-1"><span class="para-num">1.</span><p>By Ahrendt The first attack on the Herrmann message came from Ahrendt. We have already examined some of Ahrendt's affidavits, filed for the purpose of confirming Hinsch and destroying the confessions of Herrmann and Hilken, and we have found that Ahrendt's affidavits were false :</p></div>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>391 (a) In his attempt to confirm Hinsch's alibis, that is to say, Hinsch was so closely confined at Baltimore and New London, respectively, while engaged in the U-boat activity, that it was impossible for him to have been engaged in sabotage ; (b) In claiming that, after Hinsch arrived in Mexico, he did not hear from Hinsch and did not know in what form of activity he was engaged ; (c) In asserting that he never heard of any explosive tubes, incendiary pencils or glass tubes used by Hinsch or anybody else, or of the existence of any such devices, and that he was ignorant of any sabotage activities of Herrmann, Hilken or Hinsch. After filing of the Herrmann message on July 1, 1931, and its identification by Hilken (Ex. 904(3) ), and its identification by Herrmann (Ex. 904 (4) ), filed on the same date, the German Agent, Dr. Tannenberg, secured from Ahrendt an affidavit made February 10th, 1932, and filed as German Annex 73 on August 15, 1932, the object and purpose of which was to show that no message written by Herrmann had been received by Hilken in April, 1917, and, there- fore, that the message contained in the Blue Book Magazine for the month of January, 1917, which Hilken swore he received the latter part of April, 1917, was a forgery. This was the first attack. In this affidavit (Ger. Ann. 73), Ahrendt relates that he met the German Agent, Dr Tannenberg, at the offices of the North German Lloyd in New York. The German Agent explained to him the supplemental petition for rehearing and showed him the affidavit of Paul G. L. Hilken filing the Blue Book message (Ex. 904(3) ) and the affidavit of Fred L. Herrmann verifying the Blue Book message (Ex. 904 (4) ). According to his statement under oath, Ahrendt carefully examined these affidavits and also the photostatic copies of the message, and carefully noted what Hilken and Herrmann had said in their respective affidavits in regard to the January, 1917, Blue Book message. Ahrendt made comprehensive denials, under oath, of ever having seen a message in the Blue Book of January, 1917, or any other magazine; that he had ever heard of any such message or that he had ever received any message from Herrmann during his stay in Mexico; or that he had ever heard of any such message. He denied that he ever heard from Hilken that he had ever received this message. He also denied that he had any knowledge of statements made by Hilken and Herrmann with reference to raising the message by means of a hot iron. He made oath that he stayed continuously in New London with Captain Hinsch from April 6, 1917, until May 25, 1917, when he left New London with Captain Hinsch en route to New Orleans, and that he arrived in Baltimore May 26th and left Baltimore May 27 th. Taken in connection with his other affidavits, which we have already exam- ined, the object and purpose of Ahrendt's affidavit, as drafted by Dr. Tannen- berg, was to show that, on account of the close relationship between himself, on the one side, and Hinsch and Hilken, on the other (which had been shown in other affidavits), Ahrendt would have been in a position to know whether there had been any written message from Herrmann to Hilken, and, though the statement is not directly made, the inference to be drawn from the affidavit (and its only purpose) was that, since he had never heard of such a written message, therefore, no such written message was ever received by Hilken. The mention of the fact that Ahrendt was continuously in New London on or about the time when Hilken alleged that the message was brought to him in Baltimore and that he did not see Hilken in New London during that time, was part of the circum- stances upon which he and the German Agent relied to show that no written message had come from Mexico to Hilken.</p>
<p>392</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>It has been already shown, in another connection, that, when Hilken received the Herrmann message from Gerdts, he left Gerdts in his home in Roland Park, and on April 27, 1917. went to New London to have an interview with Hinsch in regard to the message. On April 28th Hinsch and Hilken left New London and went back through New York and thence to Baltimore. This is borne out by the entry in Hilken's diary for Saturday, April 28th, which reads as follows: " Saturday 28 4 a m with Capt. H. Leave 11am train and Congressional for Baltimore." (Ex. 583, Ann. D.) As we have seen before, Captain Hinsch and Gerdts dined with Hilken in his Roland Park home on Sunday the 29th, and on Monday Gerdts says that Hinsch gave him $1,000 and told him to go back to Mexico (Ex. 626 (a), Rec. p. 2773) ; but Hinsch and Hilken both went back to New York on that date, as shown by the diary entries for the 29th and 30th of April. Therefore, the statement in Ahrendt's affidavit (Ger. Ann. 73) that he had not seen Hilken in New London between April 6, 1917, and May 25, 1917, while evidently made for the purpose of proving that no written message was received by Hilken, failed dismally, and, taken in connection with Siegel's statements showing that there was a written message carried by Gerdts to Hilken, this affidavit convicts Ahrendt of fabrica- tion, just as his famous postscript in his letter to Hilken did. In Siegel's first statement, witnessed by the German Consul on the 16th of March, 1932, and filed on the 27th of May, 1932, Siegel stated that it was decided by himself and Herrmann to send Gerdts to Baltimore to obtain funds; that Gerdts was given an American magazine to take along; that the necessary communications were written cross-wise to the print in lemon juice on several pages of the magazine ; that the information was written down partly in normal writing and partly in code; that, after the report had first been drawn up on a sheet of paper he dictated the same to Herrmann who wroLe it in the American magazine ; and that Gerdts had returned after about the middle of May and brought with him much less money than Herrmann expected (Ex. 908, Ann C). After this statement was filed, it was no longer possible for the representatives of Germany to carry out their first line of attack and the efficiency of Ahrendt's affidavit was completely destroyed. It was no longer possible to claim that no written message had been sent by Herrmann to Hilken and, therefore, the tactics were changed. It was then admitted that Herrmann had sent a written message to Hilken, but it was claimed that the Blue Book message was a forgery, and for this purpose there were filed on August 27, 1932, Hinsch's affidavit (Ger. Ann. 71, verified on June 28, 1932), and Siegel's second statement (Ger. Ann. 69, verified July 15, 1932).</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-2"><span class="para-num">2.</span><p>By Himch Siegel's first statement (Ex. 908) showing that a written message to Hilken had been put into Gerdts' hands and that he had been sent by Herrmann to Hoppenberg and Hilken, destroyed Ahrendt's attack on the message, and it then became necessary to change the line of attack. Therefore, Siegel's second state- ment (Ger. Ann. 69) and the affidavit of Hinsch (Ger. Ann. 71) were brought forward for that purpose. It was no longer possible to claim that there was no written message, and, therefore, in Hinsch's affidavit, it was admitted that a written message had been brought by Gerdts to Hilken but it was claimed that the Blue Book message was a forgery. To establish this proposition, it was claimed by Hinsch, first, that the message which Gerdts brought to Hilken consisted of one page, not four; second, that it contained an identification of</p></div>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>393 Gerdts, with an assurance that he could be trusted and a request for $20,000 or $25,000; and, third, that it contained a statement that Gerdts would report verbally about all other matters. It was further claimed that Gerdts was unknown to both Hilken and to Hinsch and, therefore, needed identification. To substantiate the assertion that he was unknown to Hilken and to Hinsch, it was alleged that Hinsch and Hilken dis- cussed whether they could trust Gerdts or not, but that since Gerdts stated to Hilken certain particulars in regard to the submarine enterprise known only to Herrmann, Hinsch was of opinion that Gerdts had come from Herrmann and was not, by any chance, an agent of the American Intelligence Service who had taken " the book " away from Herrmann's messenger at the border. There are some minor allegations necessary to be examined: (1) Gerdts reported being closely watched at the border and that he came a roundabout journey to Hilken's home. (2) Hilken was disturbed about the possibility that Herrmann's message might be found in his possession and, therefore, Hilken and Hinsch determined to destroy it without delay. (3) The message brought by Gerdts was written in invisible ink (which did not require heat for development) and not in lemon juice (which did require heat for development) ; and to substantiate this claim it was asserted that lemon juice was a primitive medium for writing secret messages, outmoded at the time the Herrmann message was composed, and not used at all in 1916 and 1917 for invisible writing, and that the unprinted sheet of paper which Hilken had removed from the book contained the secret message and had purple discolora- tions. It was further claimed that the message was contained not in a magazine but was contained in a book with a stiff cover, and that it was written on one white page not on four printed pages. Some of the attacks made by Hinsch depend merely upon the veracity of witnesses affirming or denying; for example, that it was written on a single white page, not on four printed pages. As to these contentions, we do not make any progress by simply saying that we believe Hinsch, or by saying that Hinsch is a liar; neither does Hinsch's statement gain any weight by a mere recital of facts contradicting the message in the Blue Book. Before proceeding to analyze the attacks made by Hinsch on the message, it is proper to study the message as described by Hinsch. The message described by Hinsch conforms with the Blue Book message in two particulars, first, it was a request for money, and, second, it represented that the bearer would make a verbal report. It differed from the Blue Book message in two particulars, first, it was short and written on one white page, whereas the Blue Book message was lengthy and written on four printed pages; and, second, the message as described by Hinsch called the name of the bearer, Raoul Gerdts, and assured Hilken the bearer could be trusted, whereas the Blue Book message did not call the name of the bearer and made no such assurance. Surely, if Gerdts had been unknown to Hilken when he brought the Herrmann message to Baltimore, the insertion of his name and the assurance that he could be trusted with $25,000 would not have been any inducement to Hilken to entrust him with so large a sum, and, as is admitted, Hilken only gave him $1,000 and sent the balance by Hinsch. It is interesting to note that Hinsch's account of Gerdts' verbal report conforms in almost every respect to the Herrmann message as contained in the Blue Book, to-wit,</p>
<p>394</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>( 1 ) Herrmann was short of money ; (2) Herrmann could not obtain money from von Eckardt, the German Minister; (3) Von Eckardt distrusted Herrmann; (4) Herrmann had told von Eckardt of the " U-Deutschland " expedition and mentioned Hilken's and Hinsch's names to no effect; (5) Herrmann was in Sonora; (The message says " I expect to go north but he (Hinsch) can locate me thru Eckhardt ".) (6) Hinsch refers to the fact that Herrmann wanted him to come down to Mexico to take command of an auxiliary cruiser. The message says : " Am in close touch with major [Schwierz?] and influential Mexicans Can obtain old cruiser for 50000 West Coast." (7) Hinsch refers to Herrmann's request that he come down to Mexico. The message says: " Tell Hinsch to come here." Thus, nearly every statement which Hinsch claims to have gotten orally from Gerdts is actually contained in the Blue Book message. In addition, Hinsch's statement confirms the record as to the authority which Herrmann had received more than a year before to set fire to the Tampico Oil Fields and the doubt which the German Minister had expressed to him when this story was repeated to him. In order to analyze and study the attack made by Hinsch, it is necessary to make a careful study of the record to determine whether Hinsch's various attacks may be substantiated. We will endeavor to make this study under the following heads : (1) Was the border being closely watched when Gerdts came to Baltimore? (2) Was the Herrmann message destroyed? (3) Was the Herrmann message written in lemon juice or invisible ink? (4) Was Gerdts unknown to both Hilken and Hinsch when he brought the Herrmann message to Baltimore? (5) Was the message written in a magazine or a book with a stiff cover? Hinsch's Attach (1) Was the Border Being Closely Watched When Gerdts came to Baltimore? In his affidavit of June 28, 1932 (Ger. Ann. 71, filed Aug. 15, 1932), Hinsch stated as follows (p. 6) : " Gerdts also told us, in the course of the conversation, that he had been closely watched at the border and that Herrmann had told him that he should go out to Roland Park only when he felt sure he was not watched. As a matter of fact, he had come to Hilken's home only after a long, roundabout journey." This language is practically repeated by the Umpire in the decision of December 3, 1932, where the Umpire said: " * * * the border was being watched for secret correspondence; the situation was so tense that Hilken was under actual surveillance and his home was being searched." (Decs, and Ops., p. 1022.) z In making this statement the Umpire was justified, not only by the testimony of Hinsch but also by the argument of the German Agent (Washington Argu- ment, November 23, 1932, p. 197), in which he represents that Gerdts was sent 2 Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 118.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>395 " across the border at a time when the border was most carefully watched ", almost the exact language attributed to Gerdts in Hinsch's affidavit. When Hinsch left Baltimore for Mexico on May 27, 1917, after the United States had entered the war, Ahrendt accompanied him to El Paso, Texas (Ger. Ex. CII, pp. 84, 85, filed July 2, 1930). Their movements after they got to El Paso are described by Ahrendt in his examination by Dr. Tannenberg as follows (id. p. 85) : " We left the train at El Paso, Texas, and I went across the border to see whether it was difficult or not to go across the border, and discovered that it was quite an easy feat to cross the border and came back, and Hinsch and I got into an automobile for a sight-seeing trip around El Paso. The guide asked whether we would like to see Mexico and we said, ' Why, surely, if we could,' and he drove us across the border, and I left Hinsch in Juarez." In the course of his examination the following ensued (id. p. 89): " Q_. How was it possible for you to cross the border? " A. Why, that is what Captain Hinsch commented on; that in the case of war that a country was so lax at its border. They had sight-seeing cars that were transporting people around El Paso, and anyone that expressed the desire could stay in this car and ride across the border and see Juarez. When you reached the international border there were some American officials there who looked in the car to see whether you had any munitions, or guns, or revolvers. They simply asked us; they didn't lift a seat and look; a man said, ' Have you any ammunition or firearms? ' And we said, ' No ' He said, ' Go ahead.' " Q.- Was it necessary to have a passport? " A. Not at all. " Q. Did these officials examine any papers you had? " A. Not a thing. " Q,. Is it right that anybody who crossed the border in a sight-seeing bus could do that without any difficulty? " A. No difficulty at all at that time." Again (id. p. 91): " Q,. And when you crossed the international border, what kind of an examination was there by the American officials? " A. None at all; simply that they asked whether we had any ammunition or firearms in the car. We were asked for no papers, and it was a very easy affair. " Q,. Did the American officials ask you about your nationality? "A. No." On August 11, 1932 (Ger. Ann. 74, filed August 15, 1932), Ahrendt made another affidavit in behalf of Germany in which he introduced his Pullman stubs for his trip with Hinsch from New York to New Orleans en route to the border, from which it appears that Hinsch and Ahrendt left New London on Friday, May 25, 1917, and went from New Orleans to El Paso on May 29th. The affidavit proceeds (p. 3) : " There we got off the train. At El Paso, Hinsch and I crossed the border after we had found out that this could be accomplished without difficulty, as I have previously testified in my affidavit of April 11th, 1930." It will be recalled that, before Hinsch left the country, a presidential warrant for his arrest had been issued (Ord. Ex. 343, Rec. p. 4258). On August 15, 1932 (translation filed August 27, 1932), the German Agent filed Hinsch's affidavit of June 28, 1932 (Ger. Ann. 71). This affidavit as origin- ally drafted by Dr. Tannenberg (Ger. Ann. 132) and as finally executed by Hinsch, contained the following language :</p>
<p>396</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>" Gerdts also told us, in the course of the conversation, that he had been closely watched at the border and that Herrmann had told him that he should go out to Roland Park only when he felt sure he was not watched." (Emphasis supplied.) On the same day, August 15,1932, that he filed Hinsch's affidavit, the German Agent filed Ahrendt's affidavit of August 11, 1932 (Ger. Ann. 74). In this latter affidavit, Ahrendt, after filing his Pullman receipts and showing that he and Hinsch had arrived at El Paso on May 29, 1917, repeated his statement in his former affidavit (Ger. Ex. CII) as follows: " At El Paso, Hinsch and I crossed the border after we had found out that this could be accomplished without difficulty, as I have previously testified in my affidavit of April 11th., 1930." (Emphasis supplied.) It thus appeared that Hinsch crossed the border going to Mexico about one month after Gerdts had already crossed the border carrying the message to Hilken in Baltimore and only a very short time after Gerdts had recrossed the border on his return to Mexico, and Hinsch had commented to Ahrendt on how lax the United States, a country at war, was in watching its border (Ger. Ex. CII, p. 89). Therefore, at the time when Hinsch made his affidavit of June 28, 1932, he could not have been unmindful of the ease with which he and Ahrendt had crossed the border on May 29, 1917, just about a month after Gerdts had gone to Baltimore. Thus, on the same day that he filed Ahrendt's affidavit, the German Agent filed Hinsch's affidavit directly contradicting Ahrendt; and in the Washington argument in November, 1932, the German Agent used Hinsch's affidavit on this point without referring to the fact that he had already filed two affidavits of Ahrendt which directly contradicted Gerdts' statement as reported by Hinsch. On October 17, 1933, Ahrendt testified again about his trip with Hinsch to El Paso (Ex. 975, Ann. C, pp. 103-105). He said that they had no difficulty at the border, and it was all right for you to carry anything in your pockets without interference from any guards; that there was no search made; that the only question asked was whether you had firearms, guns or ammunition; that he did not agree with the opinion of the Commission that the border was carefully watched. Ahrendt in the same examination testified that not long after Hinsch left, he accompanied, in the early part of August, 1917, the lady who subsequently became Hinsch's wife to Laredo, Texas, and that she had no difficulty in getting across the border in a cab with her baggage (id. pp. 236-240). Ahrendt went across first and bought her a ticket and had no difficulty going or coming across the border (id. p. 239). We know that Anton Dilger arrived in this country from Berlin on July 4, 1917 (Ex. 943), that he followed Hinsch to Mexico carrying secret ink which he had received from the German General Staff (Ger. Ann. 75). Witzke crossed and recrossed the border at least twice in the summer of 1917 on missions for Jahnke (Ger. Ex. O_, p. 5). Jahnke apparently had no difficulty in crossing the border into Mexico in May, 1917 (Ger. Ex. P, p. 4; Ger. Ex. Q., p. 4). James J. Larkin, the well-known Irish labor agitator, in his affidavit of January 2, 1934, tells about a trip he made from New York to Mexico City in the latter part of August, 1917, to confer with Eckardt (Ex. 990, Ann. A. p. 17). That Larkin came from the United States to see von Eckardt in Mexico City in the summer of 1917 is confirmed by von Eckardt in his affidavit of April 16, 1934 (Ger. Ann. 95). It would seem clear that the sole foundation for Hinsch's claim that the border</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISION</h2>
<p>397 was being watched is found in Gerdts' affidavit (Ex. 626), where he said (Rec. p. 2772): " I remember that when I arrived at Mr. Hilken's home and asked for him, a woman, probably thinking that I had some business of interest to Mr. Hilken, told me to leave the house immediately and come back in about a half hour because at that time special investigators were inspecting the house." As we have already seen, Hilken denied that when Gerdts came to his houses, it was being watched; but, according to Hilken, Gerdts may have had in mind an incident, when some hoodlums in Roland Park had painted a sign, " To Hell with the Kaiser", on the concrete walk leading from the street to his house and Mrs. Hilken had complained to the police, and it was possible that when Gerdts arrived, a policeman may have been there (Ex. 976, Ann. E, p. 139). In Ex. 921-M-3, filed June 1, 1932, there is a photostatic copy of a report dated November 1, 1917, written by R. M. Campbell, Captain, U. S. A., Military Attaché, from the city of Mexico to the Chief, Military Intelligence Section, War College Division, Washington, D.C. The report deals with the activities of a certain female messenger carrying secret messages in the soles of an extra pair of shoes carried by her, having a little compartment in the sole for the reception of the letters. In the course of the report he uses the following language (paragraph 6) : " The woman who was to have carried these letters has made frequent trips from here north, and there is strong evidence to believe that all these trips have been made for the purpose of carrying letters for the propaganda committee, or the German Legation. I am informed, and believe the information is trustworthy, that on none of these trips has she entered the United States, but that she has gone sometimes to Nuevo Laredo, sometimes to Piedras Negras, and sometimes to Matamoras. This reveals the fact that German agents in the three Mexican towns have means of getting documents across the frontier without the knowledge of our authorities." (Emphasis supplied.) Thus as late as November 1, 1917, the Military Attaché reports to the War Department that German agents in the three Mexican border towns had the means of getting their documents across the frontier without the knowledge of the authorities of the United States. (2) Was the Herrmann Message Destroyed? It is claimed by Hinsch that Hilken was disturbed about the possibility that the Herrmann message might be found in his possession and, therefore, that he and Hilken determined to destroy the message without delay. If the message simply consisted of an identification of Gerdts, with a request for funds and no more, such a message was not dangerous and would not have disturbed Hilken, and there would have been no necessity for its destruction. Indeed, such a message need not have been secret or written in invisible ink. (3) Was the Herrmann Message Written in Lemon Juice or Invisible Ink? In order to prove that the message contained in the Blue Book was not a genuine instrument, Hinsch claimed that the message which Gerdts brought to Hilken in Baltimore " had been written with a secret ink which could not be developed by heat and, consequently, not by means of a hot iron " (Ger. Ann. 71, p. 6.); and he further claimed that " Invisible writing fluids which could be made visible by heat would not have been used at all in the years 1916/1917, for such important communications, since it would have been too easy to make messages produced with such fluids visible " (id. p. 6).</p>
<p>398</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>It was claimed that since letters written in lemon juice could be developed by heat, this method was primitive, and offered no guaranty of secrecy ; that Hilken and Herrmann, upon returning from Germany had brought secret inks in pow- dered form; and therefore Herrmann could never have counted on Hilken, of all people, to accept such a message (id. pp. 6, 7). He claimed that the unprinted paper upon which Hilken developed the message showed that the secret writing had been made visible in the way typical of developing invisible inks, and that the whole sheet had slightly purple discolor- ations typical of the secret ink (id. p. 7). In his affidavit of January 11, 1929, Gerdts recited that he was ordered by Herrmann to go from Mexico to New York to collect $25,000, and that the order and instructions given by Herrmann were written in lemon juice on a page in a book of poetry, and stated that in the same book of poetry there was written another order, also written in lemon juice (Ex. 626(A), Rec. pp. 2772, 2773). This affidavit was executed nearly two years before Hilken claims to have rediscovered the Blue Book in his attic (Christmas 1930). At the time Gerdts executed the affidavit (January 11, 1929), the only refer- ences in the record to his carrying a message from Herrmann are found in Layton's despatch of August 1, 1917, where Gerdts is reported as saying that Herrmann " sent me to New York by train with some letters, which I delivered " (Ex. 583, Ann. G, Rec. p. 2347); and in Guyant's report of August 24, 1917, where Gerdts is reported as saying that " he was ordered by Herrmann to proceed to New York by rail with a verbal order for 325,000.00 to be received from one Hoppenberg "(id. Ann. H, Rec. p. 2351), and there was no contro- versy as to invisible messages, whether in lemon juice or not. Gerdts had no reason or inducement to tell a falsehood as to the medium used by Herrmann for transcribing his message. There is, therefore, not the slightest reason to doubt the truth of Gerdts' statement, made before any controversy arose, that lemon juice was the medium used by Herrmann for transcribing his message. In his second affidavit of July 17, 1933 (Ex. 979, Ann. A), Gerdts was asked how he knew that the Herrmann message was written in lemon juice and he stated : " Because I bought the lemon myself and brought the lemon to Hermann to the Hotel Paglach, Avenida Juarez, Mexico City, where we were living and I saw him writing the message myself." He also testified that he was with Herrmann when he was writing the message. The fact that the message which was written by Herrmann and transported by Gerdts to Hilken in Baltimore was written in lemon juice and not in the so- called invisible ink, is substantiated by the affidavit of Mrs. Hattie Shannon. Mrs. Shannon wrote to the Umpire on April 9, 1934, offering to testify. Her letter was referred to each Agent, and as a result her affidavit was secured (See motion of American Agent, August 16, 1935, p. 5). In her affidavit she testified as follows: She was a passenger on a steamship sailing from Buenos Aires July 14, 1932. The steamer was boarded at Rio de Janeiro by Gerdts on July 30, 1932, and they were fellow passengers for three weeks and in each other's company a great deal (Ex. 999-A, p. 1). During their conversations Gerdts informed her of his association with a number of German spies in the United States, one of whom was Fred Herrmann. He told Mrs. Shannon about a Blue Book Magazine of 1917 which concerned the Black Tom blast, and which book he said involved both Herrmann and himself. The affidavit continues:</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>399 " He said the magazine contained a message written in lemon juice and then explained to me that to develop lemon juice writing, a medium hot iron must be used in order to prevent the paper from scorching. He went into a great deal of detail about this magazine but as I was not interested, I paid little attention to what he said. He also told me that he did not know the contents of the messages he carried, that he simply followed the orders of those higher up " (id. p. 2). Gerdts told Mrs. Shannon an incident about the inoculation of horses being loaded for shipment to Europe, and that a short time after they left port they all died (id. p. 2). In Exhibit 999, Ann. B, Mrs. Shannon relates that shortly prior to Gerdts' leaving the ship at Puerto Colombia, he promised to write her a letter in the manner similar to the one written in the Blue Book and gave her instructions how to develop it. He sent such a letter, which was written in the ordinary form, but by application of heat another letter written with lemon juice was made visible, and she filed with her affidavit a letter, dated September 8, 1932, contain- ing both the visible and invisible letter. At the time when Mrs. Shannon met Gerdts, to-wit, July 30, 1932, Hinsch's affidavit attacking the Herrmann message and claiming that the original mes- sage was written in invisible ink had not been filed. Indeed, when Gerdts wrote his letter to Mrs. Shannon September 8, 1932, and superimposed on it a letter in lemon juice, he could not have known anything about Hinsch's affidavit, which was filed on August 15, 1932. As we have already seen, Siegel, in his first statement (Ex. 908, Ann. C), written in his own handwriting, unequivocally testified, on March 16, 1932, that the Herrmann message was written in lemon juice. As we know, Siegel's second statement, verified July 15, 1932, was filed on August 15, 1932, the same date that Hinsch's affidavit attacking the message was filed. In his second statement (Ger. Ann. 69, p. 4) Siegel testified as follows: " That the message is supposed to have been written by Herrmann with lemon juice, he himself told me. This also seemed to me believable since I recalled a fluid which was not ink. It is, however, quite possible that Herrmann used a secret ink. I myself received, later on, from Hinsch whose acquaintance I made in Mexico, a powder for making secret ink for my own communications, and the developer belonging thereto, which made the secret writing appear in a blue color while the paper itself became slightly discolored. I still recall, for instance, that I could hardly make out one message which I myself received, because the writing, in developing it in the fluid, had run so badly. Furthermore, when Herrmann and Hinsch jointly sent secret messages from Mexico they used secret ink of like ap- pearance." In this instance, as in other details of the message, referred to in his second statement, Siegel was unwilling to denominate his first statement as false, but related matters outside of the message and not relevant to the point at issue for the apparent purpose of convincing the Commission that the message might not have been written in lemon juice. In order to confirm Hinsch's claim that the Herrmann message was not written in lemon juice but in invisible ink, the German Agent again brought forward Woehst as one of Hinsch's principal backers. In Woehst's affidavit of July 8, 1932 (Ger. Ann. 76, filed August 15, 1932), Woehst described the method of developing secret inks and the appearance of the paper after the secret message had been developed. He then related that when he, Woehst, left the United States, in the middle of February, 1917, Herrmann took him to the boat and he gave Herrmann his entire supply of powder for making secret ink. Then he states (p. 7) :</p>
<p>400</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>" As I mentioned in my deposition of July 24, 1930, Herrmann did not under- stand very well, in the time during which we were together, how to write with invisible ink. Since the writing becomes invisible as soon as the ink dries, a certain skill is required for writing the lines evenly and leaving proper space between the lines. I cannot say from personal knowledge whether and when Herrmann acquired sufficient skill in that respect." In his affidavit of July 24, 1930 (Ger. Ex. CXXIV, filed August 18, 1930), referred to by Woehst in the quotation above, Woehst recited his and Herrmann's joint activities after, as he claimed, he could not get a visa for a passport to Italy. He stated that he and Herrmann, always working together, were engaged in investigating the movement of munitions over railroads and terminals to trans- atlantic steamers (id. p. 41). As he had been specially trained in the Intelligence Service, he made the reports to the Admiralty Staff, written with invisible ink, and, since Herrmann did not then know how to use the ink, the reports were written by him (Woehst) alone (id. p. 46). Here again, was an evident attempt on the part of Woehst to bolster one of Hinsch's false affidavits. The fact that German secret service agents in the United States were using lemon juice for secret writing is clearly established by the report of A. G. Adams of the Department of Justice, under date of February 26, 1917 (Ex. 583, Ann. N, Rec. pp. 2367 et seq.). This report shows that the agent, on February 24, 1917, went to 600 West 115th Street, the apartment which had been occupied by Hauten (Woehst) and March (Herrmann). The agent found there a letter reading in part as follows: " Dear Hauten: " If letters come for me from Perth Amboy, open them and heat them. If there is any news, you can forward it to the right party. * * * * * * * " (Signed? £M " It is clearly established from the record that this letter was written by Herr- mann to Hauten (Ex. 976, Ann. E, pp. 96-98; Ex. 986, Ann. A, pp. 95 et seq.). The letter also shows that Herrmann was expecting from Perth Amboy letters written in an invisible fluid that required heat to develop, as he directs Woehst to " open them and heat them." The only purpose of heating these letters, of course, would be to develop the invisible writing, and this letter has the effect of discrediting Woehst, not only in his attempt to confirm Hinsch's statement with regard to invisible ink, but also shows clearly that Woehst was thoroughly acquainted with the sabotage activities of Herrmann. (4) Was Gerdts Unknown to Both Hilken and Hinsch When he Brought the Herrmann Message to Baltimore? The main theme towards which Hinsch's affidavit was directed, namely, that Gerdts was not known to Hilken or to Hinsch, and, therefore the sole purpose of the message was to identify Gerdts to Hilken has already, in another connec- tion, been proven to be false. (See, supra this Opinion, p. 118).aa It will be recalled that the German Agent, in German Annex 132, set out the original draft of Hinsch's affidavit; and in that original draft, it was asserted that, up until the meeting in Hilken's home on Sunday, April 29, 1917, Gerdts was "unknown to me [Hinsch] ". It will likewise be recalled that this affidavit was prepared by the German Agent in America from notes which he made in Berlin, and the German Agent's draft was forwarded to Berlin, for execution. Before the affidavit was executed, the word " me " was changed to " us ", so that the executed form of the affidavit (Ger. Ann. 71) contained the statement that a a Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 322.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>401 Gerdts was " unknown to us ", that is, to both Hilken and Hinsch, up until Sunday, April 29, 1917. To the original draft of the affidavit, as found in German Annex 132, was added also the statement that, since " Hilken reported that Gerdts had stated to him certain particulars with regard to the submarine enterprise, which only Herrmann could have known, I [Hinsch] was then of the opinion that Gerdts had really come from Herrmann and was not, by any chance, an agent of the American Intelligence Service who had taken this book away from a messenger of Herrmann at the border " (Ger. Ann. 71, p. 4). This false statement that Hilken did not know Gerdts until the meeting in Hilken's home on Sunday, April 29, 1917, was repeated by Hinsch in German Annex 72, p. 3, where Hinsch says: " Hilken and I saw Raoul Gerdts for the first time at the end of April, 1917, when he brought the message from Herrmann." As a matter of fact, Hilken, two days before the meeting in his home, had invited Gerdts to stay at his home, had given him $175, and left him there as a guest while Hilken went to New London to consult Hinsch, thus indicating clearly that this was not the first time that Hilken had seen Gerdts. Surely Hilken, on Friday, would not have been paying money to Gerdts and leaving him as a guest in his home, and, on Sunday, been discussing with Hinsch whether Gerdts, by any chance, was an agent of the American Intelligence Service who had taken the " book " away from a messenger of Herrmann at the border. An examination of the Hilken-Lowenstein-Hoppenberg correspondence discloses the fact that about four months preceding the meeting in Hilken's home Hilken sent Lowenstein a letter, introducing Gerdts and recommending him for a position. In addition, Gerdts was so well known to Hilken that, in his diary for April 29, 1917, Hilken makes an entry that was " dining with ' cousin Raoul ' and Hinsch ". (See, supra, this Opinion, p. 121.) bb Hinsch claimed that on account of the fact that he and Hilken did not know Gerdts before the meeting in Hilken's home, they had a discussion as to whether Gerdts could be trusted with a large sum of money such as $25,000. If this discussion took place, it was not because Hilken did not know Gerdts, but probably because he did know him, for, as we have seen in another connection, Hilken did not have a high opinion of Gerdts (Ex. 976, Ann. E, pp. 103, 104). Hinsch's added touch, explaining why he became convinced that Gerdts was not an agent of the American Intelligence Service who had taken the " book " from a. messenger of Herrmann at the border, was as false as his claim that Hilken did not know Gerdts. Thus, we have another example, showing that Hinsch was only too willing to accommodate his statement to the needed proof, and his spurious affidavit can no longer be used to attack the Herrmann message. (5) Was the message written in a magazine or a book with a stiff cover? It was claimed by Hinsch that on the Sunday when he went to visit Hilken in his home in Roland Park, about three weeks before he started on his trip to Mexico, Hilken showed him a book from which the unprinted white front or back fly leaf had been torn or cut out and that " it was a book with a stiff cover " which was of the ordinary size of a novel (Ger. Ann. 71, p. 2). The source of this claim is probably in Gerdts' first affidavit where he stated that Herrmann gave him an order and instructions which were " written in lemon juice on a page in a book of poetry " and that " in the same book of poetry there was another order also written in lemon juice " (Ex. 626 (a), verified January 11, 1929, Rec. p. 2772). b b Note by the Secrétariat, this volume, p. 324.</p>
<p>402</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>It will be observed that Gerdts did not say that " the book of poetry " had a stiff cover. In his second affidavit of October 28, 1931 (Ex. 979, Ann. D- 1), Gerdts was shown four photographic copies from the Blue Book magazine and identified the same as the actual message which he carried. In his third affidavit of July 17, 1933, he was shown photostats of four pages of the Blue Book magazine of 1917 containing the Herrmann message and he again recognized these four pages as a copy of the message which he carried to Baltimore and he stated that the book in which the message was written was similar to a January 1917 Blue Book attached to his affidavit (Ex. 979, Ann. A). The fact that when Gerdts arrived in New York he was carrying a magazine containing a message for Hoppenberg, is clearly established in the affidavit of Johan A. van Emmerik, dated October 28, 1932 (Ex. 948). Van Emmerik was a naturalized American citizen, born in Holland, and came to the United States in May, 1916. Before coming to the United States he had spent a number of years in the Far East obtaining experience in all branches of the rubber industry. On arriving in New York he became intimate with Ed Weber, manager in New York for Weber, Schaer &amp; Co. and he rented desk room in Weber's office in a building on Water Street, which had an entrance on Pearl Street. Together with Weber, van Emmerik enjoyed considerable patronage from the Eastern Forwarding Company in supplying rubber for the cargoes of the submarine merchantmen, and became friendly with Hoppenberg, the manager in New York for the Eastern Forwarding Company. He also became friendly not only with Hoppenberg but with some of his friends among whom were Herrmann and Raoul (Gerdts). In February, 1917, Hoppenberg abandoned his office on Battery Place and shared Weber's office in the aforesaid building. The day after Hoppenberg's death Raoul (Gerdts) arrived in the office and Gerdts and van Emmerik had a meal together at Reisenwebers, a famous German restaurant. Gerdts was wearing a raincoat and carried a magazine which he said contained a message to Hoppenberg and also stated that he had to find Hilken. At the restaurant Gerdts kept the magazine beside him at the table and a waiter when placing the food on the table picked up the magazine by the cover and tore it. At this Weber flew into a rage and insisted on checking the magazine but Gerdts protested against it. This experience was indelibly impressed on van Emmerik's memory. Gerdts left immediately for Baltimore. In the oral argument of 1932 the German Agent seems to ridicule the idea that Gerdts was so careless " as to be carrying this message so that everybody might see it " and he says: " Certainly if this message were authentic Herrmann would have cautioned Gerdts very much indeed. He would have instructed him to be as careful as possible so that nobody would see that he was carrying a secret message." (Oral Argument, 1932, p. 199.) It was not unnatural, in the first place, for Gerdts to take the maga- zine to Hoppenberg for it was to Hoppenberg that he was to deliver the magazine. By his argument the German Agent seems to think that the magazine was transparent and would advertise the fact that it contained a secret message which was supposed to be invisible !</p>

<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-3"><span class="para-num">3.</span><p>Attack by Osborn and Tannenberg Acting as Investigators or Sleuths The third attack on the Herrmann message was by Osborn and Tannenberg cooperating as investigators or sleuths. Reduced to its last analysis, they charge that the Blue Book magazine of January, 1917, in which Herrmann wrote the message, had been purchased in New York City in February, March or April, 1931, from Abraham's Book Store, and, therefore, the message written therein was not the actual message written by Herrmann in 1917 and carried by Gerdts to Baltimore in April, 1917, but that the message produced by Hilken had been forged by Herrmann in 1931. According to Osborn, a short time previous to October 28, 1931, he was engaged by Dr. Tannenberg " to examine the Herrmann message in the claim against Germany " (Ex. R with Osborn's Exam. July 9, 1937). On October 28, 1931, he made a " pilgrimage " to Abraham's Book Store " to see if he could obtain a copy of the Blue Book Magazine of January, 1917 " (Ex. R with Osborn's Exam. July 9, 1937). On the same date, to-wit, October 28, 1931, Osborn wrote Dr. Tannenberg two letters, the first evidently before his visit to the book store. In this first letter, he related the receipt of bound copies of the Blue Book Magazine including the January, 1917, number, secured by Dr. Tannenberg from the Library of Congress. He expressed surprise at their good condition, and he stated some of the problems before him as an expert. He expressed his intention on that date: " to visit the old magazine places [*] here and will try to find a series of magazines covering perhaps four months time on paper similar to that used by the Blue Book Magazine Company." He stated that it would be desirable to get a number of magazines printed on paper of the same kind and perhaps to file a page from each showing the gradual change in the magazine covering a period of six months. Nowhere in this letter does he indicate any opinion on the problems before him as an expert (Ex. P with Osborn's Exam. July 9, 1937). After his visit to Abraham's Book Store, Osborn on the same date, to-wit, October 28, 1931, wrote a second letter to Dr. Tannenberg. In that letter, after relating his visit to the book store, and " an interesting and exciting pilgrimage " which he had had, he said: " I am putting the matter into the form of a deposition, thinking that perhaps you will want to present it but I am doing this partly while the matter is fresh in my mind and not suggesting that this is the final form. The proposed deposition which I enclose will give the information regarding my morning experience. " You will see from the proposed deposition enclosed herewith that in the first instance no particular magazine was sought for, but merely ' an old magazine ' but the second inquiry asked for an additional copy or specifically for a copy of the January, 1917, Blue Book Magazine. " My recollection is that your conference regarding the demand for $750,000 was either in March or April, or about that time, [2] and / have no doubt that the January, 1917, Blue Book in evidence in this case was bought at this store last Spring. 1 Instead of visiting " old magazine places ", on October 28, 1931, Osborn in fact only made a " pilgrimage " to Abraham's Book Store and satisfied himself that the Blue Book containing the message was purchased there in the spring of 1931. His visit to Abraham's was undoubtedly due to the fact that Osborn on October 28, 1931, had been advised by Stein that the claimants had purchased a copy of the January, 1917, Blue Book at Abraham's on April 29, 1931. 2 As to the " conference regarding the demand for 5750,000 ", when this letter was read by Dr. Paulig in his examination of Osborn, p. 299, the figure was reduced from 8750,000 to 87,500, and in his question based upon this letter, Dr. Paulig</p></div>
<p>4 0 4</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>" The fact that a second copy was asked for would indicate either that those who purchased the evidence of this claim were seeking a copy of the magazine, or that another attempt to manufacture the document was necessary or thought advisable, and then the best of the two could be used. " Of course, it would be impossible I suppose to say who might have gone to this store to secure this copy of the magazine, but you may be able to guess who it was, but I suppose it would be difficult to arrange so that Mr. Meyers could see whether or not he could recognize the man. * * * * * * * " I obtained the December, 1916 copy of this magazine and also the February, 1917, copy." (Ex. Q. with Osborn's Exam. July 9, 1937.) (Emphasis supplied.) From the above letter it will clearly appear that Osborn, since the dictation of his first letter and after his visit to Abraham's Book Store, had already come to a definite conclusion on the question as to which he was employed as an expert. That this is so is further confirmed by the entry in his diary (Ex. U with Osbom's Exam. July 9, 1937) for October 28, 1931, which reads as follows: " In the morning went to old book dealers for copy of January, 1917 Blue Book in Explosion case. Learned that copy used in this case was probably procured at Abraham's. Wrote Dr. Tannenberg &amp; prepared affidavit for Mr. Meyers, employed at Abraham's." The proposed affidavit which was prepared by Osborn on October 28, 1931, for Meyers to execute reads as follows (Ex. S with Osborn's Exam. July 9,1937) : " H. MEYERS, being duly sworn, deposes and says: " My name is H. Meyers, and I am connected with Abraham's Book Store at 141 Fourth Avenue, New York City. " About six or seven months ago, approximately March or April of this year, a man called at this store and I waited upon him, and he ashed for ' old magazines ' of eleven or twelve years of age, without specifying any particular magazine or exact date. I got out some of the old magazines, including a bundle of copies of the Blue Book, and he said, ' I will take this number ', which was that of the January, 1917, Blue Book, and paid for it and took it away with him. " About a week afterwards a telephone inquiry came to the store, asking whether we had another copy of the January, 1917, Blue Book Magazine, and I informed the inquirer that we had. We keep a list of the magazines we have on hand on separate cards, and our card originally indicated that we had one magazine of December, two of January, and some of the following months. In response to this telephone inquiry someone came and obtained the second copy of the January, 1917, Blue Book Magazine, which was delivered in response to this telephone inquiry. " Mr. Meyers further deposes and says that this Abraham's Book Store advertises that they have on hand copies of old magazines, and this fact is advertised on the windows in the front of the store. " Mr. Meyers further deposes and says that he does not know the purpose of this deposition or what its bearing may be. " Mr. Meyers further deposes and says that he does not think that he could recognize the man who first came for the magazine but that he might do so, his recollection being that the man wore a topcoat and this recollection had some connection with the date at which time the first magazine was obtained." (Em- phasis supplied.) At the time of his examination, Osborn also produced a paper prepared by himself entitled " Statement of Mr. Albert S. Osborn ". In this paper Osborn again uses the language " $7,500 "instead of" $750,000 " and he asked Mr. Osborn : " Have you any recollection of that? * * * A. I do not know what that refers to at all. I do not recollect anything about it." See Osborn Exam., July 9, 1937, pp. 292, 299, 300.</p>

<h3 class="doc-h3">" STATEMENT OF MR. ALBERT S. OSBORN</h3>
<p>"On October 28th, 1931, shortly after I had been engaged to examine the Herr- mann message in the claim against Germany, I went to Abraham's Book Store at 141 Fourth Avenue, New York City, to see if I could obtain a copy of the Blue Book Magazine of January, 1917. I met there Mr. H. Meyers, a clerk, and, according to my best recollection, he said: " ' About six or seven months ago, approximately March or April of this year, a man called at this store and I waited upon him, and he asked for " old magazines " of eleven or twelve years of age, without specifying any particular magazine or exact date. I got out some of the old magazines, including a bundle of copies of the Blue Book Magazine, and he said, " I will take this number ", which was that of January, 1917, Blue Book Magazine. He paid for it and took it away with him. " ' About a week afterwards', Mr. Meyers continued, ' a telephone inquiry came to the store, asking whether we had another copy of the January, 1917, Blue Book Magazine, and I informed the inquirer that we had. We keep a list of the magazines we have on hand on separate cards, and our card originally indicated that we had one magazine of December, two of January, and some of the following months. In response to this telephone inquiry someone came and obtained the second copy of the January, 1917, Blue Book Magazine, which was delivered in response to this telephone inquiry.' " Mr. Meyers informed me that he thought it would be impossible for him to recognize the man who first came for the magazine, but that he might be able to do so. " On the same day of this interview I made a written memorandum regarding this interview, and it is from that memorandum that I am now making this statement." * (Em- phasis supplied.) A comparison of these papers (Osborn's second letter of October 28, 1931, his draft of Meyers' affidavit, and the " Statement of Mr. Albert S. Osborn ") discloses the fact that H. Meyers, the " clerk " interviewed by Osborn and from whom he bought two magazines, made a statement to Osbom of the circum- stances of selling two copies of the Blue Book Magazine of January, 1917. In the " Statement of Mr. Albert S. Osborn " (Ex. R), Meyers is quoted as follows : " About six or a man called at I of eleven or twelve years of age, without specifying any particular magazine or exact date." This language is copied verbatim in the proposed deposition, and, in Osborn's second letter of October 28th, this same point is emphasized by the following language: " You will see from the proposed deposition enclosed herewith that in the first instance no particular magazine was sought for, but merely an • old magazine ' * * *." (Ex. Q. with Osborn's Exam. July 9, 1937.) There can, therefore, be no mistake as to what Meyers told Osborn about the sale of the first Blue Book magazine, namely, that the prospective purchaser " asked for ' old magazines ' of eleven or twelve years of age, without specifying any particular magazine or exact date ". There is no controversy that the Herrmann message was delivered to Hilken late in April, 1917. Would a prospective purchaser in 1931 have in mind forg- ing a 1917 message in requesting a magazine of eleven or twelve years ago? If or seven months ago, approximately March or April of this year, : this store and I waited upon him, and he asked for ' old magazines ' 1 This contemporaneous memorandum was never produced by Osborn. 27</p>

<p>he had purchased a magazine of "eleven years of age ", he would have gotten a magazine published in 1920; and if he had purchased a magazine of" twelve years of age ", he would have gotten a magazine published in 1919. Obviously no magazine of this character would have fitted his purpose. On October 29, 1931, Osborn wrote another letter to Dr. Tannenberg in which he used the following language : " If you think it is advisable to get an affidavit from Mr. Meyers of Abraham's Book Store, this perhaps could be done on Saturday. / have an idea that Mr. Meyers will not hesitate to sign an affidavit, with perhaps a small compensation, $10 or possibly $25. Nothing was said about this in any way the other day, but of course he must have inferred that the magazine had been obtained for some purpose that was being investigated. " It seemed to me that the affidavit might be obtained without his knowing what it was for, not that the matter is concealed from him, but that this would show that he was entirely non-partisan in the matter. " / think it is absolutely certain that this is where the magazine was obtained that was used in this case * * *." (Correspondence filed by Osborn Sept. 16, 1937.) (Em- phasis supplied.) Under date of November 6, 1931, H. Meyers executed an affidavit, prepared by Dr. Tannenberg, purporting to give Meyers' account of the interview with the prospective purchaser. In the affidavit as prepared by Tannenberg and as executed by Meyers, the corresponding paragraph reads as follows : " Several months ago, according to my best recollection, approximately in February, March or April of this year, a man called at this store and Mr. Abraham, Jr. the owner's son, waited upon him. I was present when this man came in. The man asked for a Blue Book Magazine of the year 1917 without specifying any particular monthly issue ofthatyear. We keep our old magazines dating back many years in the back room of our store. So Mr. Abraham, Jr. asked me to get a copy of the Blue Book Magazine from the year 1917 from the back room." (Ger. Ann. 55, Ex. (a.) ) (Emphasis supplied.) It will be observed that there are several differences between the affidavit as prepared by Osborn and the affidavit as prepared by Dr. Tannenberg. In the Osborn draft, Meyers is represented as saying: " I waited upon him ". In Tannenberg's draft, he is represented as saying: " Mr. Abraham, Jr. the owner's son, waited upon him ". In Osborn's draft, the statement was that the purchaser asked for old magazines of eleven or twelve years of age without specifying any particular magazine or date. In Dr. Tannenberg's draft, the statement is that he " asked for a Blue Book Maga- zine of the year 1917 without specifying any particular monthly issue of that year ". In the second letter of October 28, 1931, and in the " Statement of Mr. Albert S. Osborn " and in the affidavit prepared by Osbom for Meyers to execute, the time of the visit of the purchaser was " about six or seven months ago, approximately March or April of this year ". In the affidavit as prepared by Dr. Tannenberg, the time of his visit is stated to be " several months ago, according to my best, recollection, approximately in February, March or April of this year ". Here we have another example of changing an affidavit to meet the needed proof. It will be recalled that when Hinsch's affidavit, attacking the Herrmann message, was first prepared, it was stated therein that Gerdts was unknown to " me " (Ger. Ann. 132); but, when it was finally executed, it was changed to meet the needed proof so as to read unknown to " us " (Ger. Ann. 71). Manifestly the affidavit of Meyers, as originally prepared by Osborn, would not have met the needed proof, but would have been disproof of the very fact which the German Agent was trying to establish.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>407 It is also a remarkable fact that the " Statement of Mr. Albert S. Osborn " (Ex. R July 9,1937) has on its face changes and notations in the handwriting of Dr. Tannenberg. 1 One of the additions written by Dr. Tannenberg is that immediately before the word " March ", the word " February " is inserted in pencil so as to make the same read " approximately February, March or April of this year ". If Osborn was telling the truth in his " Statement ", in his draft of Meyers' affidavit, and in his second letter of October 28, 1931, Meyers' statement of the facts relating to the sale and purchase of the Blue Book magazine in February, March or April, 1931, would be of no use in this case to show that the purchaser intended to forge in the magazine requested a message purporting to have been written about the middle of April, 1917. On the 22nd of August, 1932, the German Agent executed an affidavit entitled " Statement of the Agent of Germany ", giving an account of the activities of himself and Osborn in securing the Blue Book magazines and the information from Abraham's Book Store through the " clerk ", Mr. Meyers (Ger. Ann. 55). In this statement he related an unsuccessful attempt to get a copy of the Blue Book magazine and other magazine copies requested by Osborn for purposes of test and comparison; he endeavored to get such magazines while in New York but was not successful. After his return to Washington, Osborn advised the German Agent that he, himself, would try to obtain a January, 1917, copy of the Blue Book magazine which he thought might be obtained more easily in New York than in Washing- ton. The German Agent's statement then proceeds as follows: " On the occasion of my next stay in New York, at the beginning of November, 1931, Mr. Osborn told me that he had inquired of the news dealer in the building where one could obtain old numbers of magazines; that the news dealer had given him the name of Abraham's Book Store; that he had looked up the address of this store which he had found was Abraham's Book Store at 141 Fourth Avenue, New York City, and had gone to that store, on October 28, 1931, to see if he could obtain there a copy of the BLUE BOOK MAGAZINE of January, 1917. Mr. Osborn further told me that in that store he had met a clerk whom he had asked whether they had a January, 1917, copy of the BLUE BOOK MAGAZINE; that the clerk had gone to look and on his return had told him that they did not have a January, 1917, copy but did have a December, 1916, and a February, 1917, copy of the BLUE BOOK MAGAZINE and that he recalled that several months ago they had sold the only two copies of the January, 1917, issue of the BLUE BOOK MAGAZINE they had had at their store at that time; and that in the course of the ensuing conversation the clerk, whose name he later learned was Meyers, had told him, in substance: " That several months ago, approximately February, March or April of last year, a man had called at their store and asked for an old magazine or a BLUE BOOK</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">MAGAZINE</h3>
<p>of 1917, (Mr. Osborn was not quite certain whether he had understood the clerk correctly), without specifying any exact date; that he had gotten out a bundle of copies of the BLUE BOOK MAGAZINE of 1917; that he had sold to the man, upon his request, a copy of the January, 1917, BLUE BOOK MAGAZINE and that the man had paid for it and taken it away with him." (Ger. Ann, 55, pp. 1, 2.) (Emphasis supplied.) A comparison of this statement with the record as we now have it will show certain remarkable discrepancies from the facts. First, according to the German Agent's statement.Osbom made to the Ger- man Agent a ve-bal report of Meyers' dealings with the prospective purchaser. The German Agent failed to mention the fact that Osborn in October had made See Dr. Paulig's question to Osborn, Exam. July 9, 1937, pp. 295, 296.</p>
<p>408</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>three written records, identical in language, of Meyers' statement and sent them to him in a letter confirming and emphasizing these statements. Second, the German Agent represents that Meyers' statement as given by Osborn was as follows : " That several months ago, approximately February, March or April of last year, a man had called at their store and asked for an old magazine or a BLUE BOOK</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">MAGAZINE</h3>
<p>of 1917, (Mr. Osborn was not quite certain whether he had understood the clerk correctly), without specifying any exact date; * * *." (Emphasis supplied.) whereas, as will clearly appear from Osborn's second letter of October 28th, and from Osborn's statement and Osborn's proposed draft of the affidavit for Meyers to sign, Meyers' statement was as follows: " About six or seven months ago, approximately March or April of this year, a man called at this store and I waited upon him, and he asked for ' old magazines ' of eleven or twelve years of age, without specifying any particular magazine or exact dale." (Emphasis supplied.) Third, in the letters and draft of the proposed affidavit and in the statement of Osborn, there was no intimation or suggestion that the writer was uncertain as to whether he understood Meyers, but the statement of Meyers, repeated three times and emphasized in the letter sending the draft of the proposed affidavit, was definite and certain; whereas in German Annex 55 the statement is made that " Mr. Osborn was not quite certain whether he had understood the clerk correctly ". When the letters of October 28, 1931, and the " Statement of Mr. Albert S. Osborn " were introduced by the present German Agent on July 9, 1937, with Osborn on the stand (Osborn's Exam. July 9, 1937, pp. 292-300), no explana- tions were offered by Osborn of these discrepancies and no questions were asked in regard thereto. There are other statements in German Annex 55 which are worthy of notice. On page 2 we find the following: " On November 5, 1931, I went to Abraham's Book Store * * * and asked for Mr. Meyers. I met Mr. Meyers and referred briefly to Mr. Osborn's visit at his store about a week ago. I asked Mr. Meyers about the sale of the two January, 1917, BLUE BOOK MAGAZINE copies which he had mentioned to Mr. Osborn * * *." (Emphasis supplied.) The implication here is that Osborn was not present. In the affidavit of Herman Meyers, executed October 29, 1932 (Ex. 954), referring to the sale of magazines which he made to Osborn, Dr. Tannenberg and Dr. Grossman, he gave an account of a telephone call from a man who gave his name as Osborn, and inquiry for the Blue Book magazine for January, 1917, and of Osborn's first visit (October 28, 1931) to the store, and then his affidavit proceeds as follows: " Afterwards, early in Novenber 1931, Mr. Osborn returned to my store with another gentleman whom he introduced as Dr. Tannenberg. Dr. Tannenberg told me that he represented the German government in the Black Tom matter. Both he and Mr, Osborn questioned me a lot about the number of January 1917 Blue Books which I had sold, and as to the times when I might have sold them. " Mr. Osborn then asked me if I would sign an affidavit of what I had said. As a matter of fact, I hesitated to sign an affidavit. I had never made an affidavit in a law suit before in my life. Moreover, my recollection of the times was too vague for any positive fixing of dates, and I did not want to sign so indefinite a statement. Mr. Osborn and Dr. Tannenberg, however, were apparently satisfied with the indefiniteness of my statement, and Mr. Osborn took me aside and asked me</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>409 if I would make the affidavit for Dr. Tannenberg as a favor, saying that Dr. Tannenberg wanted it for his record, and was buying a number of magazines from me. " The next day Dr. Tannenberg returned with a written statement, and asked me to sign it. This is my affidavit of November 6, 1931, which, as I have seen in Washington, is now marked German Annex 55 (a)." (p. 7) (Emphasis supplied.) In view of the letters written by Osborn to Dr. Tannenberg set out above, the paper entitled " Statement of Mr. Albert S. Osborn ", the proposed affidavit drafted by Osborn, the " Statement of the Agent of Germany ", and the testi- mony given above by Meyers, it is interesting to read the oral argument of the German Agent, Dr. Tannenberg, at Washington in 1932, bearing on the same subject, where the German Agent (Oral Argument, 1932, p. 225) said: " I stated in my affidavit that Meyers at that time volunteered further informa- tion and that Osborn informed me about this matter. When I went to New York I of course interviewed Meyers alone. There is in Meyers' affidavit which has recently been presented by the American Agent (Exhibit 954) a statement to the effect that Osborn and I went to Abraham's Book Store where Osborn introduced me. In my statement, Annex 55, I said that I, after having received this information from Osborn, went to Abraham's Book Store and examined Meyers there. Mr. Osborn has not taken any part in this investigation. The fact that he informed me about what he had learned for what it was worth does not speak against him. " There are further statements in Meyers' recent affidavit to the effect that Osborn asked him to give me an affidavit because the German Agent would then buy a number of magazines. I can assure the Commission that the witness is mistaken. I examined the witness personally on November 5 and 6, 1931. Mr. Osborn was at Abraham's Book Store on November 5 in connection with the purchase of magazines. The American Agent has used this affidavit by Meyers in his attempt to discredit Osborn. I think the short reference to my examination of Herman Meyers is sufficient to dispose of that criticism. Obviously Meyers did not realize what these statements meant, and obviously he was mistaken." (Emphasis supplied.) Osborn filed with the Commission transcripts from his diary, relating to the sabotage cases, but the transcript (Ex. H) did not include entries for October 28th or for November 5th, 1931. In Osborn's diary for October 28, 1931, there is the following entry: " In the morning went to old book dealers for copy of January, 1917 Blue Book in Explosion case. Learned that copy used in this case was probably procured at Abraham's. Wrote Dr. Tannenberg &amp;. prepared affidavit for Mr. Meyers, employed at Abraham's." Under examination of Osborn by the Umpire, July 8, 1937, the following occurred (p. 160) : " I find in your diary, but not in the transcript of the diary, a record of your going there. How did you omit that from the transcript you furnished me? " A. This transcript was made by my secretary. " Q.- When you produce it I think you vouch to us for its accuracy, Mr. Osborn. " A. It says that I went to old book dealers for a copy of January, 1917, Blue Book. That is October 28th. " Q_. Go on, read the rest of it. "A. ' For copy of January, 1917, Blue Book in explosion case. Learned that copy used in this case was probably procured at Abraham's. ' " O_. From whom did you learn that? " A. That was an inference. " Q_. You do not say you inferred it; you say you learned it. Now, Mr. Osborn, you use the English language accurately. From whom did you learn it? " A. The copy in this case was probably " Q,. From whom did you learn it?</p>
<p>410</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>" A. The manager there told me that someone had bought the January book a few months before and this was merely an inference; I did not know and he did not know at all anything about it excepting that there was that particular magazine bought a few months before, and also there were some other circumstances con- nected with the interview. Shall I tell you what they were? " Q,. I do not want them. I want answers to my questions and not speeches." It may be a mere coincidence, but it is also a fact, that on October 28, 1931, Mr. Stein inquired of the claimants where they had purchased a January, 1917, Blue Book, and he got the information on that date that it had been purchased at Abraham's Book Store (Ex. 982, Ann. B, pp. 13, 14; and id. Ann. D, pp. 2 and 3; also Trans. Stein Exam. Oct. 26, 1937, pp. 404, 410). In the course of the examination of Osborn by the Umpire on July 8, 1937, the following colloquy occurred (p. 165) : " Q_. Do you confine yourself to the examination of disputed documents, or do you do investigative work? " A. I DO NO INVESTIGATIVE WORK. [Emphasis supplied.] " O_. How did you come to take an affidavit from Mr. Meyers? Is that part of the examination — " A. I did not take any affidavit from him. " Q. Were you present when one was taken? " A. No. " Q_. I find an entry in your book, ' Wrote Dr. Tannenberg and prepared affidavit for Mr. Meyers, employed at Abrahams '. What does the word ' prepared ' mean? " A. I included in my letter to Dr. Tannenberg the statement that I thought that information that I had obtained should be put in the form of an affidavit. " O_. And you prepared one? " A. Yes, I think so, a suggested one. What I prepared was not used. " Q.- Well, now, I would like to know again whether the English language is accurately used in your diary? Does ' prepared ' mean 'prepared ' or ' suggested '? " A. That was put in the form of a suggestion. That was sent to Dr. Tannenberg. My affidavit was not used. " Q,. Mr. Osborn, you have been on the witness stand many, many times? " A. Many times. " O_. And it will do you no good to fence with this Commission. " A. I am not going to try to do it. " O_. You are trying to do it, in my opinion. " A. I am sorry. " Q,. I am sorry, too. " A. I did not mean to do that. " O_. I think you are competent enough to give me categorical answers and you are certainly competent enough to understand my questions. " A. I will try to do it exactly. " THE UMPIRE. I think I have no further questions." In this connection it is interesting to note the entry in Mr. Osbom's diary for November 5, 1931, reading as follows: " Dr. Tannenberg here. Spent the day with him on explosion case. Went with him to Abraham's Book Store &amp;• arranged about affidavit of H. Meyers." (Emphasis supplied.) Thus it appears from Osbom's diary that on October 28, 1931, he "prepared an affidavit for Mr. Meyers, employed at Abraham's "; and on November 5, 1931, he went to Abraham's Book Store with Dr. Tannenberg and " arranged about affidavit of H. Meyers ". In spite of this, in his 1932 argument, the German Agent assured the Commission that when he went to New York : " I of course interviewed Meyers alone ".</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>411 And he further said : " Mr. Osborn has not taken any part in this investigation." He also denied that Osborn asked Meyers to give him an affidavit. Under examination by the American Agent, Osborn quibbles again in the use of words when he claims that the only purpose for which he went to Abraham's Book Store was: " to see if I could get a copy of the magazine, and this information was volunteered to me and I merely made a copy of it in this form, partly to fix my immediate recollection of what had occurred." (p. 238) He further claimed that the main purpose in preparing the affidavit was to put in definite form the information which he had been given. He did not make any reference to the assurance in his letter, not yet produced, that Meyers would be willing to make an affidavit with a " small compensation " — S10 or S25. When the German Agent's argument, stating that " Mr. Osborn has not taken any part in this investigation ", was read to him, he said: " That is true "; and he afterwards added : " excepting giving him the information that came to me. * * * but the in- formation was volunteered; I did not go there for the information " (p. 239). The American Agent then read him the entry in his diary for November 5th showing that he went with Tannenberg to Abraham's Book Store and " arranged about affidavit of H. Meyers ", and asked him: " so you and he went there to arrange for an affidavit by Meyers' " " A. I went with him to show him the way, more than anything. " Q,. He did not know the way? " A. I suppose he could have found it, but I went with him. " Q,. It was necessary for you to go with him to show him where the book store was, Abraham's Book Store? " A. No, I do not think it was necessary but I found the man that had given me the information before and introduced Dr. Tannenbaum to him and Dr. Tannen- baum prepared " (p. 239). Again he was asked (p. 240) : " When you went with Dr. Tannenberg to Abraham's Book Store, you went there to get the affidavit, did you not? " A. Dr. Tannenberg did. " Q,. But you went with him to help him get the affidavit, did you not? " A. I think that he and Mr. Meyers had to go somewhere, I do not remember where, but the ending of it, my recollection is I had no part in it at all." And again: " Q.. Dr. Tannenberg in the same argument said, ' When I went to New York I, of course, interviewed Meyers alone '; is that correct? " A. Well, I introduced him to Mr. Meyers. " Q_. Then he did not go alone; you went with him to show him the way? " A. / did not say I went to show him the way. I went to introduce him to the man who had given me the information; * * * But as far as his interviewing Mr. Meyers was concerned, that was his own matter; I did not take any part in that. * • * " (p. 240) (Emphasis supplied.) As we have seen above, Osbom, in response to a question by the Umpire, specifically stated: " I do no investigative work " — and tried to wriggle out of the position he was placed in when he had to admit he had prepared an affidavit for Meyers' signature. Neither he nor the German Agent referred to the fact that he had written a letter to the German Agent making the sly suggestion that " Mr. Meyers will not hesitate to sign an affidavit, with perhaps a small compen-</p>
<p>412</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>sation, $10 or possibly $25 " and that " the affidavit might be obtained without his knowing what it was for ". Under these circumstances, any further work which Mr. Osborn did as an expert was necessarily colored by his opinion, already formed, and by the charac- ter of the work which he had done as an investigator. Another example of the activities of Osborn and the German Agent as inves- tigators or sleuths is found in the Qualters' story. The object of the development of this story was to further the preconceived conclusion of Osborn that Exhibit 904 is not the magazine used by Herrmann in Mexico in 1917 to transmit a message to Hilken but that it is a magazine which Herrmann obtained in 1931 from Abraham's Book Store in New York City and therefore that the message written and found in Exhibit 904 is a forgery. The Umpire, in the Washinton Decision of December 3, 1932, reviews the evidence then in the file with reference to the Qualters' story, as follows (Decs, and Ops., pp. 1024-1026) : cc " Another matter of note is that the January, 1917, Blue Book, when filed with the Commission, concededly bore certain marks in lead pencil opposite some of the titles of the stories on the index pages. These apparently went unnoticed by Hilken or Herrmann or the American Agent. Some time after the submission of the magazine the German Agent observed them. He subsequently bought a number of other issues of the Blue Book for other months of the year 1917 to be used for comparison and for the use of his expert. These he procured from Abra- ham's Book Store in New York. They contained similar marks. In several of them were found bills which indicated that the magazines had been delivered by a newsdealer in Brooklyn to a house at 756 Madison Street in Brooklyn. Further investigation developed that one Qualters lived in that house and had in 1930 sold a large number of Blue Book, Red Book, and Adventure magazines to Abraham's Book Store and had received a check for S12 in payment therefor. " The evidence, in my judgment, is entirely conclusive that Qualters did make such a sale, but it is not clear that he sold complete sets of all three magazines covering the years from 1911 to 1929 as he states. Subsequently both Agents purchased at Abraham's Book Store numerous magazines of the kinds mentioned. Sixteen of all those purchased contained horizontal marks and cross-marks on the index pages; some 53 of them contained only horizontal marks. The German Agent seeks to prove by the Qualters ' testimony that these marks were made by Horace Qualters and John Qualters, his brother, when and as they read the articles marked. He seeks also to account for the absence of marks during a certain period by the fact that Horace was absent during the war and was not reading the magazines currently. Qualters identifies the horizontal marks in the January issue as so like his that he believes he made them. " It appears that sometime prior to April 30, 1931, two persons purchased January, 1917, Blue Books at Abraham's Book Store. One of them is now identified as Mr. Traynor, who bought a copy on April 29, 1931, for the claimants, in order to obtain a magazine to compare with the one produced by Hilken. This copy contains no marks whatever on the index pages. The other was bought by someone who cannot be identified, whose description is most vague, the time of whose appearance at the store cannot be definitely fixed, but who, according to the testimony, did not ask for the issue of any particular month but merely for a Blue Book of 1917 and was handed a January number only because the store had two copies of that issue and could better afford to sell one of the copies for that month than to break the set by taking one of another month. Meyers and Abraham, of the bookstore, who had to do with the sales in question, do not identify Hilken or Herrmann as the purchaser of the January, 1917, Blue Book. There is no specific evidence that Herrmann, Hilken, or any agent employed by them or either of them purchased the January, 1917, number of the magazine at the Abraham Book Store. Note by the Secretariat, this volume, pp. 120-121.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>413 " Expert evidence which is not effectively challenged is to the effect that the marks as exhibited in the 1917 Blue Books and in that containing the message were not made in the order and in the manner described by the two Quakers brothers. The German Agent, however, insists that the markings found on the table of contents of the magazine containing the Herrmann message are so similar to the markings in the other magazines, some of which indubitably and concededly come from the lot purchased by the bookstore from Horace Quakers, that I may draw the conclusion that the January, 1917, magazine containing the message came from Quakers. He further animadverts upon the tardy explanations of Hilken that German agents were in the habit of using marks as keys to their codes, and of Herrmann that he believes he made the marks in the table of contents in the magazine in connection with the message to Hilken but cannot at this time determine their significance. " If I were to draw the conclusion the German Agent desires, this would end the controversy with respect to the authenticity of the message. While the evidence arouses suspicion, I cannot find in it alone enough to reach a certain conclusion. It does, however, add to the doubts which all the other facts and circumstances recited have raised concerning the document." Since the decision of December 3, 1932, the American Agent used the powers given him by the Act of June 7, 1933 (48 Stat. 117), to compel the Quakers to submit themselves to an examination before the Court. In endeavoring to secure their testimony the American Agent, as in other cases, met with the direct opposition from German sources. The witnesses were furnished with an attorney to resist the taking of their depositions, the same attorney who represented a German steamship company and had also resisted the efforts of the American Agent to secure the testimony of Ahrendt, Hilken, Sr., Dederer, Volz, and Hohme. The testimony of Horace Quakers and John Quakers, taken on August 16th and 28th, and September 13th and September 20, 1933, was filed as Exhibit 978, Annexes A, B and C, on September 15, 1933, and November 1, 1933. The original story of the method of marking the titles in the magazines as told by Horace Quakers is found in German Annex 57, and reads in part as follows : " I am in the habit of marking on the table of contents of a magazine the story which I have read and always make a horizontal dash to the left of the title of the story which I have read. * * * My brother, after he had read a story would make a vertical mark crossing the horizontal dash which I had made before, provided he read the same story I had marked. " I have inspected the pages containing the table of contents in the four Blue Books above referred to [of February and May, 1917, and March and April, 1918], and I am convinced as fully as I can be that the horizontal check marks which appear on the said table of contents, are the ones made by me and the vertical marks made by my brother." This was in the form of a letter written to Dr. Grossmann, July 13, 1932, and subsequently verified. John Quakers in a letter dated July 16, 1932, and verified the same day, writes Dr. Grossmann as follows (Ger. Ann. 58): " I am convinced that the marking appearing on the table of contents thereof [in the four Blue Book Magazines mentioned in Horace's letter] was made by my brother and myself in the manner indecated." In a subsequent affidavit, dated July 20, 1932 (Ger. Ann. 59), Horace Quakers repeated the same assertion with reference to the four Blue Book Magazines spoken of in his letter, and further says that he had examined the table of contents of the Blue Book magazine of January, 1917, containing the message (Ex. 904), and in particular the horizontal and vertical pencil marks appearing on the left- hand margin of the pages opposite the titles of the stories listed therein, and that</p>
<p>414</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>the horizontal pencil marks were exactly like the ones he used, and he had he had no doubt that these marks were made by him. When Horace Qualters was examined by the American Agent under subpoena (Ex. 978, Anns. A, B and C) he was shown the table of contents of the original Blue Book containing the message (Ex. 904), and he failed to identify a single one of the cross-marks in that table of contents as having been made by himself or his brother, and he testified that as to the four stories there marked with cross-marks, he never read three of them. He only identified one of these stories " The White Wolf" as having been read by him, and as to " The White Wolf", he was positive that the mark opposite that title was not made by himself or his brother (pp. 25-30). Therefore, the conclusion is inevitable, even from his testimony, that the cross-marks in said magazine were not the work of himself and John Qualters. He was informed by the American Agent that the expert evidence which was not contradicted by Germany established the fact that the vertical lines in the cross-marks opposite the titles in the Blue Book magazine (Ex. 904), were made prior to the horizontal lines, and then he was asked : " If that is so, would that change your opinion as to whether or not those marks had been made by you, any of those marks had been made by you? " A. Well, the fact it is contrary to the practice that my brother and I followed it would indicate that, yes, sir. " Q,. It would indicate that the vertical marks were not made by your brother at least, would it not? " A. Yes, it would." (Ex. 978, Anns. A, B and C, p. 42.) In the examination of John Qualters (Ex. 978, Anns. A, B, &amp; C, p. 74, et seq.), he was shown the Blue Book magazine of January, 1917 (Ex. 904), and was asked to look at the cross-marks appearing in that book and state whether they looked like the cross-marks which he had made. He looked at it and answered : " Well, the marks do not look like my brothers, that is the crossmarks are not mine because I never made a mark like that. These marks are too small. " Q.. You never made such a small mark as that? " A. No, I never did." And, again, on p. 76, the following occurred: " Q_. Now look at the original magazine, Exhibit 904 and state again whether those marks, the vertical marks in the cross marks were marks made by you? A. They were not made by me." As to the four stories indicated by the cross-marks, two of them he had certainly never read, one " The White Wolf ", sounded familiar to him, and one, " Yukon Trail ", he had read, but the mark opposite he indicated had not been made by him (id. p. 76). He also indicated that the Blue Book magazine (Ex. 904), was in a very different condition from any magazine which his brother had had (p. 77). The expert evidence establishes beyond the peradventure of a doubt, the fact that the cross-marks opposite the titles of the four stories in the Blue Book magazine were made in exactly the opposite sequence to that testified to by both Horace and John Qualters. It will be recalled that Horace Qualters testified that he first made the hori- zontal or minus sign and his brother came along afterwards and made the perpendicular or cross sign. Gurrin (Ex. 967), and Heinrich (Ex. 968), as experts, testified that the sequence was first the vertical sign and then the horizontal sign, and an examination of</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>415 the signs by a microscope enables the ordinary individual to appreciate the truth of the expert evidence. On this point, the Umpire in his opinion of December 3, 1932, said (Decs, and Ops. p. 1026): dd " Expert evidence which is not effectively challenged is to the effect that the marks as exhibited in the 1917 Blue Books and in that containing the message were not made in the order and in the manner described by the two Quakers brothers." In his book Questioned Documents, Second Edition, Mr. Albert S. Osborn at page 512, dealing with the subject of sequence of pencil marks, one over the other, uses the following language: " The sequence of two pencilstrokes can be determined if the strokes are made with considerable pressure so as to indent or plow into the paper slightly. Inden- tations of this character, even if very slight, can be clearly seen with the stereoscopic microscope. The upper or last line will show a continuous indentation or furrow1 across the lower, similar to two crossed strokes on a piece of wax. This physical fact can, however, only be clearly seen with the stereoscopic microscope or a stereoscopic enlarged photograph. " Pencils are made hard by including in the graphite a finely powdered clay. When a pencil mark is made with considerable pressure the path of the pencil point as worn off is a smooth glistening black line. When this line is carefully examined under proper magnification and under the suitable angle of light it will be seen on many papers that the surface of the stroke shows continuous, parallel indentations, scratches, or striae. Under just the proper lighting and magnification these scratches often show unmistakeably which of two crossed pencil lines was made last; the striae will be continuous on the last line at the crossing." The foregoing statement unquestionably represents the conclusions of Osborn when acting as a scientist. His attitude of mind on this same question when acting as an investigator or sleuth is well illustrated by the following excerpt as from his report of August 13, 1932: " I am informed that the affidavit of the writer [Horace Quakers], who says that in his opinion he made these various horizontal strokes in the January as well as the February to July Blue Book Magazine [of the 1917 issue], gives the information that his brother [John] read some of these articles and that he, the brother, had the habit of making a vertical stroke mostly over the horizontal stroke which had previously been made [by brother Horace]. Without this information it would pro- bably have been impossible to have said anything about this particular point but it is a fact that many of these notations, which now appear as crosses, do show that a different pencil was used in making the vertical, or nearly vertical, stroke than was used to make the horizontal stroke. I call attention to the three crosses in the first column in the February magazine, which all show a blacker, heavier vertical stroke, and in my opinion there are numerous others which show this same characteristic. Some of the crosses do not show that two pencils were used, although two pencils may have been used of a similar character. Some of the cross-marks do not contain all of the characteristics already described, but there are a sufficient number, in my opinion, on which to base the opinion that many of the notations in the magazines from February to July were made by the same hand that made those in the January magazine." (Emphasis supplied.) (Ger. Ann. 68, pp. 6, 7) Applying the tests well known to Osborn, the American experts, Gurrin and Heinrich, were able to determine that the cross-marks in Exhibit 904 were made in exactly the opposite sequence from what Horace and John Quakers had testified was their custom in marking titles of stories read by them. Herman Meyers, the man who sold the two Blue Book magazines about which there is so much testimony in this case, was shown Exhibit 904, and in Exhibit d d Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 120.</p>

<p>954, dated October 29, 1932, and filed November 15, 1932 (Ex. 954), he made the following statement: " Thus I may as well say at the beginning that I called on Mr. H. H. Martin, at his office in the Investment Building, in Washington, on October 7, 1932; that Mr. Martin showed me the January 1917 Blue Book which is marked ' Ex. 904 '; and that, in my opinion, it is impossible that this is a magazine which was sold from our store. Both of the January 1917 copies of the Blue Book sold from our store were in good condition, and both had front covers on them. " From my experience as a dealer in old magazines for the past sixteen years, it seems to me impossible that either of the two January 1917 Blue Books which, we sold, even assuming rough and unusual treatment of them since the sale, could now present the appearance and show the deterioration of this Ex. 904." He also testified, p. 2 : " I am told that Dr. Tannenberg has used my affidavit of November 6, 1931, to argue that one of the purchases of the January 1917 issues of the Blue Book from our store was made by or on behalf of one Fred Herrmann. On October 4, 1932, the man whose photograph is annexed as Annex No. 2 was introduced to me as Fred Herrmann, and I was asked whether or not I recognized him. I did not recognize him. * * * on seeing this Mr. Herrmann I was immediately struck by his strong resemblance to Colonel Lindbergh, or at least it seems so to me. I am sure that if I had ever seen this man before I should remember it, and I am sure that I have never seen him before in my life. " There has also been introduced to me a Mr. Hilken, whose photograph is annexed as Annex No. 3. This likewise is most certainly not the man whom I have in mind as having made the purchase. He is not nearly so tall, and is much older." By referring to his stock book records, Meyers was able to fix the time of the sale of the two magazines in the following language (p. 5): " It was not until after the new stock record was made up, doubtless early in April 1931, that the Qualters and Lincoln magazines were, for the first time, together placed on our upstairs shelves for sale. I am therefore convinced that neither of the sales of the January 1917 Blue Books, mentioned in my affidavit of November 6, 1931, was made prior to April 1931." When, therefore, the testimony given by Horace Qualters and John Qualters under subpoena is supplemented by the affidavit of Meyers, the man who sold the two January 1917 Blue Books about which so much testimony has been given, it becomes perfectly clear that it was impossible for Herrmann or Hilken, either directly or indirectly, to have purchased such a magazine and used it in this case, and the attempt on the part of someone connected with the German case to manufacture evidence has again failed.</p>

This letter written by Osborn to the German Agent, referring to the brief of the American Agent, filed February 29, 1932, contained the following: " On page 15 there is a veiled reference, ' an eminent handwriting expert ', to Mr. Stein, but there is no explanation of why he was not asked to make a report on the case outside of the handwriting, or, if he did make a report, no reference is made to what became of the reports he made."

<p>417 was a blue pencil underlining in Osborn's letter, corresponding to the under- lined [italicized] portion set out above. In Dr. Kiesselbach's letter to the Umpire (Ex. G, Osborn Exam., July 8, 1937, p. 168), he used the following language: " The letter deals with the criticism raised by Mr. Bonynge in his Motion [Brief?] of February 29, 1932, with regard to Mr. Osborn's opinion. In Page 2 thereof / marked a passus which refers to Mr. Stein's report and corroborates rather strongly the information I had and communicated to you, according to which Mr. Stein made a further report outside of the handwriting but not produced by claimants. " The remark might be valuable for our endeavours to come in this point to the truth." (Emphasis supplied.) According to the German Commissioner's letter, he had already, before May 18th, communicated to the Umpire a charge to the effect that a report which Mr. Stein had made outside of handwriting had not been produced by the claimants. No information is given by the German Commissioner as to the source of his original report to the Umpire; but it is perfectly clear that the German Agent had forwarded to the German Commissioner, and not to the Commission, the paper from Osborn which contains the veiled charge, namely, that Stein had made a report which had not been filed by the American Agent. The Umpire, in his letter of May 28, 1932 (Ex. G, Osborn Exam., July 8, 1937, p. 172), replied to the German Commissioner's letter and agreed with his conclusion in the following language: " I agree that this paragraph seems to indicate that Mr. Stein's opinion was had on matters extraneous to the mere handwriting." Under date of November 4, 1932, Stein wrote a letter to Henry N. Arnold, one of the attorneys representing the claimants, containing the following lan- guage (Ex. 982, Ann. B, Ex. A) : " The printed report of the argument at Boston in the Black Tom case leaves no doubt but that the use of my supplementary report on the handwriting in the Wozniak letters only is a distinct detriment to my reputation as a document examiner of ability and integrity. This report gives the impression that I believed the maga- zine message and letters to be genuine, while you know that I never gave any such impression, but on the contrary reported both in writing and verbally that they were not genuine and were not written in 1917. The interview regarding the writing on the edges of the magazine will vividly recall one of these reports. " If my complete report had been used as evidence, no one could misunderstand what my opinion was regarding the documents. " The argument states that I examined the handwriting only. This is not true as everyone knows who came in contact with me and I feel this misrepresentation keenly. " You will recall that after my first report on June 10, 1931 against the genuine- ness of the magazine message and the Wozniak letters, I suggested that an exami- nation of handwriting of the alleged writers written in 1917 and near to 1930 would likely show, in addition to the other things on which I had reported, that none of these documents had been written in 1917. This examination was made and the report \}~\ which you used was the result. Standing alone, this report seems to indicate that I was supporting the documents; but when read in conjunction with my earlier report and the knowledge of why the handwriting examination was made, it is clear that it is merely a negative result. " Manifestly it is unfair to me to use only this part of my report which does not represent my conclusion regarding the documents. If permitted to stand as 1 Stein apparently refers to his two reports, each dated June 26, 1931, on the handwriting of the Herrmann message and the Wozniak letters, respectively, Ex. 904 (2) and Ex. 905 (5).</p>

<p>it now is, I am allowing myself to be used to support the genuineness of the docu- ments which I believe to be fraudulent. This, I can never allow. Such conduct would be especially repulsive to me since now this case comes before Mr. Justice Roberts for whom during his active practice I gave service on many varied and important matters and whose confidence I prize highly. " In justice to me my report should be used as a complete unit and not a part which misleads a reader into the belief that this was the only report I made. " I have sent a copy of this letter to Mr. Bonynge so that some voluntary action may be taken immediately to correct this unfairness." Afterthisletterwasforwarded to Mr. Arnoldanda copy sent to the American agent, an immediate attempt was made by Mr. Arnold to see Mr. Stein, but Stein refused and made an appointment for the next day at eleven o'clock. At that time Mr. Bonynge, the American Agent, Mr. Peaslee, Mr. McCloy, and Mr. Arnold visited Mr. Stein at his office and Mr. Stein produced what pur- ported to be a copy of his alleged suppressed report. All four of the parties interviewing Mr. Stein denied any knowledge of any such report. As a result of that interview Mr. Stein wrote Mr. Arnold a letter dated November 5th (Ex. 982, Ann. B, Ex. B) which reads as follows: " After the conference today with Mr. Bonynge, Mr. McCloy, Mr. Peaslee and yourself, I have the following statement to make: " You have assured me, and I believe it that you never saw my report or heard of my report to Mr. Peto in the Canadian Car and Foundry Case on June 10, 1931. In view of this statement, I wish to withdraw all of my statements that I have made to you in my letter of November 4. " Further my attention is called to the report of the oral argument and I am satisfied that no use of my report was made before the Commission except the proof of the handwriting in the Wozniak letters and the Herman message. With this in view, I wish to withdraw any statement in my letter that might in any way reflect upon Mr. Bonynge as having misrepresented me before the commission. " I desire to withdraw my letter of November 4, in its entirety." The gentlemen present were assured by Mr. Stein that he had not communi- cated the charge made in his first letter to anyone. The Commission had its hearing on November 21-25, 1932. This was followed by the decision of December 3, 1932 (Decs, and Ops. pp. 1004-1036) &lt;*. The Petition for Rehearing was then filed on May 4, 1933. During the examination of Albert S. Osborn, July 8, 1937, the copy of the letter of A. S. Osborn, dated April 21, 1932, the letter of Dr. Kiesselbach dated May 18, 1932, and the copy of the letter of the Umpire dated May 28, 1932, from which quotations have been made above, were introduced in evidence as " Ex. G " with the Examination of Osborn (pp. 169-172). In the decision of the Commission on the 3rd of June, 1936, the Umpire, referring to the allegations of the Petition for Rehearing said : " Its allegations are, inter alia, that before the case was pleaded at Washington the then German Commissioner brought it to the knowledge of the Commission that according to information received by him Claimants had obtained a report from one of their experts the contents of which were adverse to the genuineness of the main documents on which they relied but were withholding such report from the Commission." After this reference, the Umpire made a statement showing that he had, when practicing law, retained Mr. Albert S. Osborn several times and had also consulted Mr. Elbridge W. Stein on one or more occasions. He then stated as follows : Note by the Secretariat, this volume, pp. 107-127.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>419 "Just before the date set for hearing in the sabotage cases (probably some time in November 1932), Mr. Stein attempted to get into communication with me by telephone. He wished an interview with me concerning the sabotage cases in which I knew he was a witness for the claimants. I refused to allow him to com- municate with me. " During the meetings of the Commission preliminary to the hearing, Dr. Kiesselbach advised Mr. Anderson and me that the claimants had suppressed an expert report adverse to the authenticity of the Wozniak letters and the Herrmann message. I cannot say that Dr. Kiesselbach specifically stated the source of his information. " The communication naturally disturbed me but I knew of no action that the Commission or I, as Umpire, could take in the premises and so stated. " My impression that there had been some such suppression was strengthened by Mr. Osborn's statement, in one of his affidavits, that it was remarkable that no opinion by Mr. Stein, a competent expert in such matters, had been submitted as to the age of the documents but only an opinion as to handwriting, a matter that was uncontested." The Umpire, in his opinion, further said : " The Umpire and the American Commissioner hold, that Claimants have shown, that there was no sufficient ground for suspicion, and that for this reason Claimants are entitled to a reconsideration. The German Commissioner, whilst doubting that the Claimants were actually wronged (especially as in his view mere suspicions never can be a basic element of juridical findings) takes the stand, that in inter- national arbitration it is of equal importance that justice be done and that appearances show clearly to everybody's conviction that justice was done. He does not think that the second requirement was satisfactorily complied with in the present case, and for this reason, he accedes to the conclusion of the other members of this Commis- sion." (Emphasis in original.) The affidavit of Mr. Osborn to which the Umpire referred was made on August 13, 1932, and so far as the question now being considered is concerned, reads as follows (Ger. Ann. 78, pp. 1, 2): " The second surprising reports are from Mr. Elbridge W. Stein, of New York, which merely express the opinions that the Herrmann message was written by Herrmann and the Wozniak letters were written by Wozniak, regarding which there is no controversy. Mr. Stein is not merely a handwriting expert but an expert of national reputation on all classes of problems relating to questioned and disputed documents including paper and ink problems relating to age of documents. His report says briefly : ' I am an examiner of questioned documents including questions regarding disputed handwriting inks, paper, pens, pencils and those things which enter into the physical makeup of a document. I have provided myself with the most modern scientific apparatus — photographic, optical and chemical — for the thorough investigation of all document questions.' No reports are filed from Mr. Stein covering the controverted questions in the investigation, and it is difficult to understand why these unnecessary reports of his should have been included while no other reports are presented." The part of Mr. Stein's report which is quoted above, giving his qualifications, were additions to his first report, made at the request of Mr. H. H. Martin, Counsel for the American Agent. An examination of the quotations set out above will show that in his letter to the German Agent, Osborn, on April 21, 1932, made a veiled reference to a suppressed report. After that time and before May 18, 1932, Dr. Kiesselbach, the German Commissioner, had received information which he communicated to the Umpire, according to which Mr. Stein made a further report outside the handwriting, but not produced by claimants. On May 18, 1932, the German Commissioner in his letter to the Umpire</p>
<p>420</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>reiterated the charge of a suppressed report and for that purpose enclosed the letter written by Osborn to Dr. Tannenberg. After the above decision of the 3rd of June, 1936, Elbridge W. Stein and his stenographer, Albert S. Osborn, Albert D. Osborn, M. A. Loughman, and L. A. Peto were examined before the Commission and various exhibits were filed with their testimony. Many other exhibits have been filed since the decision of June 3, 1936, and the Commission has had the benefit of lengthy and volu- minous briefs, both of the American Agent and of the German Agent. Nothing has transpired since the decision of 1936 to change the conclusion which was reached by the Commission in its decision of June 3, 1936, that there was no sufficient ground for the suspicion of a suppressed report. On the contrary, the evidence adduced since that decision strengthens the conclusion there reached and leads to the definite conclusion that the report, alleged by Stein to have been delivered on June 10, 1932, was never delivered to the claimants' attorneys nor delivered to nor received by any of the claimants, nor was any notice thereof given to the American Agent, his attorney, or to any attorney for the claimants, prior to Stein's letter of November 4, 1932, to Mr. Arnold, which letter was withdrawn by Stein on November 5, 1932. On page 109, Examination of July, 8 1937, Stein said he had discussed his alleged suppressed report only in his office with his secretary, and he denied that he ever discussed the report or spoke of its existence to anyone connected with the German Embassy, the German Agent, or experts who were employed by Germany and he especially denied having discussed the report with Osborn, Sr., or Osborn, Jr. In spite of this denial by Stein, we find that the charge of a suppressed report reached Osborn, was by Osborn brought to the German Agent, was by the German Agent brought to the German Commissioner, and by the German Commissioner brought to the attention of the Umpire. A study of the examination of Stein by the Umpire, the German Commis- sioner, the American Commissioner, the American Agent, and the German Agent shows clearly that he was evasive, given to subterfuge and self-contradic- tion. It is clear from the record that his alleged report of June 10, 1932, was never brought to the knowledge of any attorney representing the claimants or to the American Agent or his counsel. Although he claims to have sent a copy of this report, without a covering letter, to the office of one of the claimant companies, the occupants of the office and Mr. Peto deny that they have ever seen a copy of this report. The fact that Stein never delivered his alleged report of June 10th and never notified any of the claimants, or their counsel, the American Agent, or his counsel, that it had been delivered is clearly established by the record. First: Stein's claim that he advised his clients both in writing and by the delivery of his alleged report of June 10th that the instruments were not genuine and were not written in</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-1917"><span class="para-num">1917.</span><p>is disproved by his letter oj November 4th read in connection with his handwriting reports. Stein claimed in his letter of November 4, 1932, that he had advised his clients both in writing (i.e. by his alleged report of June 10) and verbally that the Herrmann message and the Wozniak letters were not genuine and were not written in 1917; and that after his report of June 10, 1931, against the genuine- ness of those instruments, he " suggested that an examination of the handwriting of the alleged writers written in 1917 and near to 1930 would likely show, * * * that none of these documents had been written in 1917 "; and he claimed that the report (of June 26, 1931) which was filed with the Commission was the result; in other words, he claimed that the reports used and filed on June 26,</p></div>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>421 1931, showed that none of the documents had been written in 1917. Let us examine his reports to test the verity of his claim. In his " Report of an Examination of Handwriting in a Magazine " (Blue Book magazine of January ,1917) Stein summarizes his report as follows (Ex. 904 (2); Ex. A with Exam, of Stein, July 8, 1937, p. 216) : " (1). I am of the opinion that the writing in the magazine was written by the same writer who wrote the diary in 1915 and the statement in 1930. " (2). I have no opinion whatever regarding the time when the writing in the magazine was written from an examination of the writing alone in comparison with the writings of 1915 and 1930." In his " Report of an Examination of Three [Wozniak] Letters " Stein sum- marized his report as follows (Ex. 905 (5); Ex. A with Exam, of Stein, July 8, 1937, p. 221): " (1). That the three letters of 1917 were written by the same writer who wrote the 1916, 1926 and 1927 letters and the matter on the photograph. " (2). That there is not sufficient difference between the writing of 1916 and that of 1926 and 1927 to identify the three letters of 1917 as having been written either in 1917 or later. It should be understood that I cannot say that these three letters were not written in 1917, neither can I say that it would have been impossible for them to have been written in 1927 or later. The positive part of my opinion is that the 1917 letters were written by the writer of the other matter." Both of these reports were dated June 26, 1931, and Stein's diary (Ex. T, Stein Exam., July 8, 1937) for that date has the following entry: " Report on letters and secret message sent to Mr. Arnold." It is remarkable that, although in his testimony he denominated these reports as " supplementary ", and his alleged report of June 10th, as his main report, the only entry in his diary for June 10th is as follows: " Examined Book for Mr. Peto 10:30 to 1 P. M.", and no entry is made for his so-called main report. In both of these cases a careful examination of the body of the reports and of the conclusions therein stated and quoted above absolutely proves the falsity of the claim made in Stein's letter of November 4th, to-wit, that an examination of the handwriting of the alleged writers written in 1917 and near to 1930 would likely show that none of these documents had been written in 1917, for in his report on the Herrmann message he says: " I have no opinion whatever regarding the time when the writing in the maga- zine was written from an examination of the writing alone in comparison with the writings of 1915 and 1930." In the report on the Wozniak letters he says that there is not sufficient difference between the writing of 1916 and that of 1926 and 1927 to identify the three letters of 1917 as having been written either in 1917 or later. Thus the falsity of Stein's contention in his letter of November 4th is clearly established by an analysis of that letter and of the reports made by him, without any necessity to resort to his testimony or to his diary. Second: Stein's claim transcends the bounds of reason. The problem before the claimants in 1931, after the Herrmann message was produced by Hilken and when Baran offered to sell them the Wozniak letters, was, first, to determine whether the instruments were actually in the handwriting of the writers, Herrmann and Wozniak, respectively; and, second, when that question should have been settled affirmatively, to determine whether they were otherwise genuine. 28</p>
<p>422</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>If the instruments, though admitted to have been in the handwriting of the writers, were written after 1917, then, so far as the claimants were concerned, they were of no value to them and any examination and report on the hand- writing would have been absolutely unnecessary. Conversely, if a negative report on the handwriting had been obtained, there would have been no further necessity for an examination and report on their genuineness. This question would have been settled by the report on the handwriting. If on June 10, 1931, Stein had verbally and in writing advised that the instruments were not genuine and that they were not written in 1917 when they purported to have been written, is it reasonable to suppose that his clients would have employed him to pass on the question of handwriting? Third: Stein's claim is contradicted by the facts in the record. (a) Stein never sent a covering letter with his report; (b) The report bore no date except in pencil; (c) Although he charged $350 for his handwriting reports, which was a very reasonable charge, considering the work done and the importance of the case, he never put in a bill or received any money for his alleged report of June 10, 1931, whereas the record shows that Osborn, for his reports and services in connection with the same documents, received $12,500; (d) Although his diary has six references in the month of June, 1931, to his work and interviews regarding the Herrmann message and the Wozniak letters, the first reference is found on June 10th. All six references are set out below: " Wednesday, June 10, 1931 " Examined Book for Mr. Peto 10:30 to P. M. f1] " Tuesday, June 16, 1931 " Conference with Mr. Peto and counsel on 1917 writing 2:30 to 4:30 [2] " Wednesday, June 24, 1931 " Mr. Loughman telephoned for an appointment tomorrow — 9 A. M. " Thursday, June 25, 1931 " Mr. Arnold and Mr. Loughman here in Peto's matter " Friday, June 26, 1931 " Report on letters and secret message sent to Mr. Arnold " Monday, June 29, 1931 " Revised reports sent to Mr. Martin in Peto's matter." (Emphasis supplied.) (Ex. T. Stein Exam., July 8, 1937.) (e) Although in his letter of November 4, 1932, he designates his reports on the handwriting of the instruments " supplementary reports ", these reports nowhere indicate that they are supplementary reports, and they do not in any manner refer to any prior or contemporaneous reports. (f) A careful study of the record, including the examination of Stein and Osborn, will show that Stein was not employed by the claimants until after June 10, 1931, the alleged date of the report; that he never saw the Wozniak letters till June 16th; that he never had sufficient opportunity to examine the instruments in order to make a comprehensive study and report on the genuine- ness of the instruments other than the question of the handwriting. Even if Stein had made a report on the Herrmann message on June 10, after an examination lasting from " 10:30 to 1 P. M.", as stated in his diary, such an examination and report would have been worse than useless, and his report, in the light of the time devoted by the other experts, both those employed by Germany and those employed by the claimants, would indeed have been to 1 " Book " evidently refers to the Herrmann message. No mention is made of the Wozniak letters. 2 " 1917 writing" evidently refers to the Wozniak letters.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>423 paraphrase his own letter, a distinct detriment to his reputation as a document examiner. Stein's threat in this case to bring his clients into disrepute before the tribunal where their claims were pending, a copy of which was sent to the American Agent for the same purpose, shows that he was endeavoring to bolster up Osborn's attack on the Herrmann message and was willing to go to any length to accomplish that purpose, even to the extent of being disloyal to his clients. While Osborn has denied that he was the source of the information which came to the German Agent and by the German Agent was brought to the German Commissioner with reference to the charge of the suppressed report, a careful study of his evasive answers on this question and of the evidence given by Stein, convict Stein and Osborn of being the source of the information brought finally to the Umpire. The events in this record relating to this charge of the suppressed report are sorry ones in juridical history, and a part of this unhappy history is the manner in which the question of Osborn's fee was presented to the Commission by the then German Agent.

<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-5"><span class="para-num">5.</span><p>The Attaik by the Experts It has been clearly established that Hinsch was guilty of perjury in claiming that he ceased sabotage activities after the U-boat enterprise started. On the contrary, after Herrmann came back to America with new devices, sabotage was carried on by him (Hinsch) and by Herrmann, under Hilken, as paymaster, with redoubled energy and with new devices. We also know that, in order to bolster up his claim that he had ceased sabotage activities after Hilken returned from Europe in 1916, Hinsch was guilty of making false statements as to his absences from Baltimore and from New London during the time of the U-boat activities at those places, respectively, as American ports. We also know that in order to prove that Gerdts was unknown to Hilken, Hinsch resorted to the worst forms of fabrication. As we have already seen, Germany brought forward Ahrendt for the purpose of discrediting the Herrmann message, and Ahrendt in his affidavit tried to persuade the Commission that no written message was delivered at all. After Siegel's first statement had destroyed the efficacy of Ahrendt's attack on the message, Hinsch, while admitting that a written message had been delivered, resorted to another fabrication, namely, the written message was very short with a request for money and an identification of Gerdts, but he claimed that Gerdts brought an oral message, which, as we have seen, conformed with the message in the Blue Book magazine of January, 1917, in many particulars but differed therefrom in some particulars. As we have already seen, where the oral message, as reported by Hinsch, did depart from the message in the Blue Book magazine, and from Gerdts' original affidavit, the oral message departed from the truth. Under these circumstances, when we begin to study the expert evidence we have this situation: (1) It is admitted that Herrmann sent a written message by Gerdts to Bal- timore. (2) The Blue Book magazine of 1917, produced by Hilken, contains a message admittedly written in the handwriting of Herrmann. (3) Herrmann, who wrote the message, has identified the same. (4) Siegel, who dictated it, identified the message in a statement written in his own handwriting. r r Note by the Secretariat, this volume, p. 429.</p></div>

<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(5)</span><p>Gerdts, the bearer of the message, has identified the message in the Blue</p></div>
<p>Book as genuine. (6) Hilken, to whom the message was sent, has produced and identified the message. (7) Herrmann and Hilken, after first being unwilling to admit their respon- sibility for the Black Tom andKingsland disasters, have either directly admitted their responsibility or have made admissions whence their responsibility must follow. (8) Ahrendt, Woehst and Hinsch, whose affidavits have been brought forward by Germany for the purpose of discrediting Hilken and Herrmann, have them- selves been discredited and have been proven to have been guilty of perjuries of the worst character. Under these circumstances, the Herrmann message, as contained in the Blue Book magazine of January, 1917, stands without the stigma which rested upon that instrument when the matter came before the Commission at Washington in 1932. The direct attacks upon the message, made by Hinsch and Ahrendt, have been shown to be false and their testimony introduced for the purpose has been shown to be perjured. The attempts by Hinsch to discredit the message by his representations as to the oral message have also miserably failed. Since the instrument has withstood the direct attacks, and the internal evidence shows no anachronisms and no state- ments which are contradicted by the record, a resort to the expert evidence seems unnecessary, especially as the Umpire in 1932 said that, as the expert evidence then stood, it was evenly balanced. When we come to examine the expert evidence introduced by Germany for the purpose of attacking the message, we find that the spearhead of the attack is Albert S. Osborn. Before Osborn began to make his study, he had assumed the role of an inves- tigator and sleuth, and we have seen that, in this character, he became a zealous partisan determined to destroy the message before he had ever subjected the same to any expert tests. We have also seen that in this role, in conjunction with the German Agent, the evidence, gathered by Osborn as an investigator and sleuth, was twisted and warped from its original form so as to meet the needed proof. We have also seen that, in conjunction with Stein, he was responsible for the false charge of a suppressed report, designed not only to substantiate the German attack on the instrument, but also to bring Stein's clients into disrepute and to smear the American Agent. It is needless to say that any expert evidence brought forward under such circumstances must be taken /-urn grano salis, if not altogether rejected as unworthy of consideration in a juridical proceeding. In one of his so-called expert reports (Ger. Ann. 78) Osborn, referring to the handwriting report of Stein, used the following language: " No reports are filed from Mr. Stein covering the controverted questions in the investigation, and it is difficult to understand why these unnecessary reports of his should have been included while no other reports are presented." (p. 2.) In his examination of July 8, 1937, pp. 175,176, Osborn was asked to define the terms " unnecessary reports " and " other reports ", contained in the above quotation, and his replies were evasive and unsatisfactory. It was brought out on the examination of Osborn that he did not know anything about the terms of employment of Stein by his clients, whether it embraced any other subject than a report on handwriting or not (Exam. July 9, 1937, p. 218). Osborn also claimed that Stein had not discussed with him the</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>425 matter of the suppressed report (Exam. July 8, p. 188) and that his " statements in regard to that matter were all based on the fact that Mr. Stein was qualified to make this examination " (Exam. July 9, p. 223). Here, then, is an example where the zeal of the sleuth overcame the scientific spirit of the expert, and led Osborn, in a so-called expert report, to make a thinly veiled charge, repeated in his letter to the German Agent, of a suppressed report when no ground existed therefor. In the decision at Washington of December 3, 1932, the Umpire, in treating the subject of expert evidence, analyzed the same as follows (Decs, and Ops., p. 1026) : ee " This consists of about one thousand pages. The questions submitted to the experts are in my belief novel. They involve at the foundation certain known qualities of ink and paper. But as one reads the testimony on both sides one is impressed with the fact that the experts themselves had to resort to experiments with lemon-juice writing on new and old paper in order to reach their conclu- sions. Many of the opinions of the experts on the one side are countered by diametrically opposite results stated by those on the other. I agree with the arguments of both Agents that certain of the experiments and tests which they criticize are not beyond fair criticism and fail to carry conviction. I entertain no doubt that all the experts retained by both litigants were inspired by a desire to do their honest best with a very difficult problem. Both sets of experts evidently believe in the soundness of their conclusions, for they challenge the Commission to make certain experiments and examinations for itself, and it is hardly con- ceivable that they would do so unless they felt that the results of such experimen- tation by laymen would justify their confidence. My experience in this behalf has, however, been most unsatisfactory and has only tended to confirm the feeling that on the expert evidence alone my judgment would be left in balance as to the authenticity of the document. Expert evidence is often an aid in determining questions of the sort here presented ; but it is far from an infallible guide, as witness the fact that several of the experts for the claimants convinced themselves of the authenticity of the Wozniak letters. This comment does not by any means apply to all of the experts who testify about the Herrmann message, and it is not to be taken as indicating that I have the slightest doubt that all of the expert's opinions are honestly entertained. It is mentioned merely as an illustration of the fact above stated, that, at best, expert evidence can usually be only an aid to judgment, and not always in and of itself so conclusive as to carry conviction. " I need only add in summary that the most careful study and consideration of the expert evidence with respect to the Blue Book message convinces me that upon that evidence alone I should not be justified in affirming the authenticity of the document. I am therefore compelled to revert to the other evidence." (Emphasis supplied.) The Umpire, after a careful analysis of the expert evidence as it stood in 1932, felt that, on the expert evidence alone, his judgment would be left in balance as to the authenticity of the instrument. This conclusion was reached while he labored under the impression conveyed to him by the German Commissioner that a report by Stein unfavorable to the genuineness of the Herrmann message had been suppressed, and when he was without any knowledge of Osborn's actions as an investigator and his complicity in changing the facts ascertained by him so as to make Meyers' affidavit conform with the needed proof. It follows of necessity that the introduction of those facts into the record has overthrown the balance, and, as all of the other experts employed by Germany followed Osborn's lead, such evidence must now be reexamined in the light of Osborn's bias and unusual activities.

<p>Osborn's Employment as an Expert (a) By the Claimants. — It is perfectly clear from the record that after the Herrmann message was produced, the American Agent made every reasonable effort to have that instrument examined by an impartial expert, and to avoid what afterwards developed, a battle of the experts in regard thereto. It is also clear that the claimants were anxious to employ Osborn, but they were met by the proposition that he might have been employed by Germany. An effort was made to ascertain whether his previous work for the German Agent prevented his employment by the claimants. Osborn's diary for June 4, 1931, contains the following entry (Ex. U, filed July 9, 1937): " Mr. Leonard Peto, Hotel Roosevelt, came in regarding new documents in case involving Canadian Car &amp; Foundary Co. U. S. v. German Govt. Told him it would be necessary for to be ' released ' before I could examine matter for him." The entry for June 11, 1931, is as follows: " Mr. Loughman, of the Canadian Car &amp; Foundry Co. called with letter from Mr. Peto regarding German Commission case." Under date of June 10th, L. A. Peto wrote a letter to Osborn referring to a " recent talk " and to a letter enclosed from Mr. Martin, Counsel for the Amer- ican Agent before the Mixed Claims Commission. In that letter Peto states as follows (Ex. E, filed July 8, 1937) : " I would like to point out that the Mixed Claims Commission is a Court or [of?] Arbitration, and during its existence has had about thirty thousand cases on which to pass. Unless the matter on which you were consulted by Dr. Grossman specifi- cally referred to matters in the Black Tom or Kingsland cases, there is no reason that we can see why you should not give us your opinion on the document which we wished you to examine. " You will see from the enclosed letter that the only expert opinion submitted by Germany in any of the cases before this Court was from a Mr. J. V. Haring. " We cannot overlook the possibility that our opponents might have consulted you without any intention of presenting your opinion. We will appreciate it, however, if you will give us a little fuller information as to whether you feel free to express an opinion on matters in these cases." It is clear from the terms of the above letter that on June 10, 1931, the date on which Stein claims to have made his report, the question as to whether Osborn would be employed as an expert by the claimants had not been decided. It is also clear that whether Osborn should be employed as an impartial expert had not yet been decided. The fact that it had not been decided as late as June 12, 1931, whether Osborn would be employed by the claimants is evidenced by the following entry in Osborn's diary for that date : " Mr. Loughman telephoned for Mr. Peto. Told him that I could not examine the matter for him because of ethics." Thus not until June 12, 1931, did the claimants learn that it was impossible for them to employ Osborn as an expert. (As we have already seen, this fact negatives the claim of Stein that he had been employed as an expert to pass upon the genuineness of the instruments, and that he did deliver his main report on June 10, 1931.) In his oral argument at Washington, 1932, in a statement justifying a fee of $5,000 to Osborn, the German Agent said (p. 136) : "Mr. Osborn was consulted by me from the beginning of July, 1931 to February 10, 1932, * * * " Mr. Osborn, as I said, worked from July to February on this matter."</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>427 (b) By the Commission. — The matter of Osborn's employment by the Com- mission as an impartial expert was still open on September 15, 1931, because on that date the American Agent wrote to the Umpire a letter from which the following is quoted: " If, after consideration of the observations I hereinafter make, the Commission shall decide that it is desirable to have the documents examined by any other expert, the American Agent would prefer to have the examination made by Mr. À. S. Osborn for the Commission, notwithstanding the fact that the German Agent has heretofore consulted Mr. Osborn in these cases." The above paragraph is quoted by Dr. Tannenberg in his letter to the Umpire, dated September 19, 1931 (Ex. 940), hereinafter quoted. Under date of September 15, 1931, Osborn wrote to the German Agent a letter which contained the following: " It of course will have to be arranged as to whether I am engaged by the parties jointly or whether I am engaged by the Commission, and of course some under- standing will necessarily have to be reached regarding my compensation." (Cor- respondence filed by Albert S. Osborn, Sept. 16, 1937.) On the next day, September 16th, Osborn again wrote the German Agent a letter containing the following: " The more I think about it, the more I am inclined to think that my examination in the claims case perhaps ought to be for you rather than for the Commission. * * * * * * * " This claim represents, I think, a larger amount than any case in which I have ever appeared, and of course if my services should be valuable the charge for the services naturally should be consistent with the case and the work done. * * * " Of course it would be perfectly proper, I think, for you, if you see fit to do so, to say to the Commission that you had already interviewed me on more than one occasion and that under the circumstances it perhaps would be better for me to appear for the German Government." (Id.) This letter is summarized by Osborn's diary entry for September 16, 1931, as follows: " Mr. Stein came over. Examined typewriting specimens with him. " Wrote Mr. Tannenberg, Washington, that perhaps it would be better, under the circumstances, that I make examination for German Govt." (Ex. W., Osborn Exam., July 9, 1937.) Under date of September 19, 1931, the German Agent wrote Osborn a letter, acknowledging receipt of Osborn's letters of the 15th and 16th, respectively, in which he recited as follows: On the 15th of September Osborn's son advised the German Agent over long distance telephone that a Mr. Loughman had come to Osborn's office on that day and informed Osborn that the claimants or the American Agent had sug- gested to the Commission that the Commission retain Osborn as their expert for the purpose of examining in regard to their authenticity the documents proffered by the American Agent. Osborn's son then advised the German Agent that Osborn had taken the matter under consideration and reached the conclusion that he would not only be willing to act as a non-partisan expert for the Commission, if the Commission should decide to select Osborn for such purpose and the German Agent would acquiesce, but that Osborn felt confident that he would be in a position to render to the Commission an impartial report, notwithstanding the fact that he had</p>
<p>428</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>been previously employed by the German Agent in a matter pertaining to the same cases and that Osborn had been consulted by the German Agent in the course of the last two months in regard to the same documents. After reciting his contact with the Umpire and his law clerk and indicating that he had postponed his trip to Boston and further consultations with Osborn in regard to the documents, the German Agent then says (p. 2) : " I have today written a letter to the Umpire of the Commission, a copy of which I enclose for your information. I have informed the Umpire in said letter that / would be willing to release you from your employment by the German government and to consent to your engagement by the Commission as a non-partisan expert to examine the documents in question on their behalf, in case the Commission should decide to retain you as their expert. You will note from my letter to the Umpire that / have made this consent dependent upon certain conditions, viz., that you should not be required to disclose to the Commission or any one else the contents of the discussions I had with you and your son and that there should be no further consultations or interviews with you whatsoever either on the part of the German Agent or on the part of the American Agent or the private parties concerned or any one represen- ting, or acting for or on behalf of said parties. These conditions are prompted solely by the desire to enable you to completely disregard any and all of the arguments I have discussed with you or any opinion that may have been expresssed, in the course of your consula tion by me, and to make the examination of the documents in question solely as a non-partisan expert on behalf of the Commission." (Em- phasis supplied.) The explanation given by Osborn in his examination of July 9, 1937 (pp. 195 et seq.), as to why he should not be required to disclose the contents of the discussions he and his son had with the German Agent was, to say the least, very vague and unsatisfactory. In the letter written by the German Agent to the Umpire, dated September 19, 1931, a copy of which was enclosed by the German Agent to Osborn, in the last preceding letter, the relations between the German Agent and Osborn are set out as follows (Ex. 940; also correspondence filed by Osborn Sept. 16, 1937) : " In this connection I may be permitted to state briefly the connections between Mr. Osborn and the German Agent. " In or about August of last year Mr. Osborn was consulted by my predecessor in office, Dr. von Lewinski, in a matter pertaining to the Black Tom and Kingsland cases, which matter, however, has no relation to any of the evidence proffered by the American Agent in support of his supplemental petition for a rehearing in these cases. This employment, as far I am informed, terminated at the end of August 1930. " After the American Agent had presented to the Commission the evidence proffered in support of his aforesaid supplemental petition, on July 1st, and prior to the oral argument in the said cases at Boston, at the end of July of this year, I consulted Mr. Osborn in regard to the purported original documents proffered by the American Agent. Mr. Osborn was then engaged by me for the purpose of advising me in this matter and making an impartial examination of the documents in question for my own guidance and information. Mr. Osborn is at present still engaged by me for that purpose, although, as I have stated above, immediately after having been informed of the contents of your letter to Mr. Bowyer of the 14th instant, I arranged with Mr. Osborn to discontinue my consultations with him until the question of his employment as a non-partisan expert to examine the documents in question on behalf of the Commission had been decided. " I informed the Commission of Mr. Osborn's previous and present engagement by the German Agent at the time the Commission consulted the two Agents regar- ding the possible service of Mr. Osborn as expert to examine the documents in question impartially for the Commission and inquired of the two Agents if either Agent knew of any objection to Mr. Osborn serving as such expert and whether either Agent had previously consulted Mr. Osborn on any point."</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>429 After setting out these relations, the German Agent then made the offer to release Osborn, upon the conditions enumerated in his letter to Osborn of the same date. On October 14, 1931, the Umpire, with the concurrence of the two Commis- sioners, forwarded a joint letter to the two Agents stating as follows (Decision of Dec. 15, 1933, p. 65 of Rept. of Amer. Com. of Dec. 30, 1933): " It has proved impossible to carry out the American Agent's suggestion that Mr. Osborn be employed by the Commission. Mr. Osborn himself is unwilling; the American Agent now objects; the German Agent's consent is subject to restric- tions, and the Commission could not accept restrictions. The Commission has now decided not to make further search for a satisfactory expert. In view of Mr. Osborn's standing in his profession, we would welcome the presentation of his testimony if the German Agent himself desires to offer it. The Commission still reserves its right to admit new evidence in these cases." Thus, so far as the Commission was concerned, the employment of Osborn was under consideration until October 14, 1931. A careful analysis of the facts recited above, mostly in the form of letters and diary entries of Osborn, establishes clearly the following propositions: (1) Although the claimants had been anxious to employ Osborn as an expert to examine the instruments, he refused to consider this employment on account of" ethics " and this refusal was first communicated to the claimants on June 12, 1931. (2) After that time the Commission itself was anxious to employ Osborn as an impartial expert and the American agent was perfectly willing for this to be done, if Osborn's engagements with, and obligations to, Germany were not of such a character as to unfit him as an impartial expert. (3) Osbom had been engaged by the German Agent for definite work before June 4th and his commitments in this regard were of such a character as to make him believe it unethical to accept employment from the claimants unless he secured a " release " from the German Agent. (4) In spite of the desire of the Commission to employ Osborn as an impartial expert, Osborn preferred the employment of the German Agent and one of the salient reasons was his hopes of a larger fee than he thought he could have secured from the Commission. (5) The German Agent was willing to release Osborn from the obligations of his employment by Germany but only upon condition that Osborn should not be required to disclose to the Commission or anyone else the contents of the discussions which the German agent had had with Osborn and his son. Under these circumstances, when Osborn's connection with the Qualters story is recalled, it is not surprising to learn, as we will see hereafter, that Osborn's attitude towards the questions at issue before the experts was far from scientific and that his attitude towards the members of his profession who differed with him in the discussion of these questions was intemperate and overbearing. The question of what was Osborn's fee is not an important one, except for the effect it had upon the Commission in its decision of 1932 and on the good faith of the German defense. In the oral argument on November 22, 1932, the German Agent in discussing the question of Osborn's fee said (p. 136): " Will the American Agent contend that a man of Mr. Osborn's standing and experience would sell his reputation for a moderate amount of money? " Mr. Osborn was consulted by me from the beginning of July, 1931, to Febru- ary 10, 1932, and during this period had worked on his opinions for more than six months. I had had various consultations with him in July, 1931, further con- sultations after the Boston argument, after the Commission in its memorandum of October 14, 1931, suggested that the German Agent present Mr. Osborn's testimony.</p>
<p>430</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>Mr. Osborn was occupied with this investigation and examination of these docu- ments from the middle of October to the end of December. He was consulted by me in February in regard to the watermarks. He has made numerous examinations and tests. He prepared an elaborate set of exhibits. And when his work was com- pleted and I asked for his bill he presented to me a bill for $5,000. " I wish to make this statement because the American Agent has attempted to show that Osborn has been unduly influenced by the matter of his fees. " Mr. Osborn, as I said, worked from July to February on this matter. The months of October, November, and December were taken up entirely by this work. And I submit to the Commission that in view of this enormous amount of work performed by Mr. Osborn the fee is, indeed, a very moderate amount, and in my opinion the best illustration that the whole attack on Mr. Osborn is wholly unjusti- fied. Certainly a man of his standing would not sell his reputation for that amount of money." (Emphasis supplied.) The inference and the direct statement of the German Agent is perfectly clear that, when Osborn's work was completed and the German Agent asked him for his bill, he presented a hill for $5,000, and that was not a sufficient amount of money to justify him in selling his reputation!! No intimation was made by the German Agent that on August 22, 1932, exactly three months before he made the statements in the argument above, Osborn had presented a second bill for $7,500, which had been approved; and on November 18, 1932, four days before his argument, Germany had made a partial payment of S 1,500 on the bill for $7,500 (Osborn's Exam, of July 9, 1937, pp. 201-203, 263-265; Memorandum by the German Agent dated June 1st, 1936, and filed June 1st, 1936). In Osborn's examination by the American Agent on July 9, 1937, the Amer- ican Agent quoted from the 1932 argument of the German Agent at Washington (p. 136) and then asked (Exam. July 9, 1937, p. 265) : " Now, as a matter of fact, on November 22, 1932, you had actually received in cash from the German Government the sum of $6,500 and you had arranged with Dr. Tannenberg in August of that year that you were to get altogether S7,500 for your last payment, so that there was still due 556,000 on that? Is that correct? " To which Osborn replied: " A. That is correct excepting the matter of dates. I don't know about the dates." The Problem for Experts Slated When Exhibit 904 was filed, the American Agent filed with it as Exhibit 904 (1) the affidavit of Aloysius J. McGrail and also the handwriting report of E. W. Stein, Exhibit 904 (2) dated June 26, 1931, filed July 1, 1931. The handwriting report of Stein was never attacked, but the German attack was based upon the proposition that, although the instrument was in the hand- writing of Herrmann, it was written by Herrmann in 1931 and not in 1917. The problem presented was a simple one : Was the message, which was contained in Exhibit 904, written before Gerdts, the messenger, left Mexico for Baltimore in April, 1917, or was the message written in a magazine which was purchased from Abraham's Book Store in April, 1931 ? Or, to state the problem in more general terms, was the message written when the paper was comparatively new and not deteriorated or was it written when the paper was about fourteen years of age? In order to solve this question, it is possible for the layman, as well as the expert, to examine Exhibit 904 and determine certain definite facts from this examination.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>431 ( 1 ) The message was written cross-wise to the print on four pages of the Blue Book magazine beginning at page 700 then in sequence backwards on 698, 696, and 694. The message consists of 34 lines, 9 of which are written on page 700, 10 on page 698, 11 on page 696, and 4 on page 694. (2) The message shows evidence of having been developed by heat and the first page (700) shows much more evidence of scorching or heat than the other pages. (3) An examination of the reverse pages, that is to say, 699, 697, 695, and 693, on which there is no writing, discloses the fact that the lemon juice or liquid has seeped through distinctly on each of these reverse pages both from blots on the other side and from the writing where there are not blots. (4) The writing on the first page (700) is much heavier and there are more blots on that page than on any other. (5) The lemon juice or liquid has struck through, or penetrated, all of the written pages and in many places it is possible by using a mirror on the reverse page to read the words from the back, and this is true on all of the four pages. (6) The deterioration of the paper by coloring and embrittlement is much more noticeable around the edges than in the other portions of the page, but all the pages containing the message have become very brown and show a deteriorated condition. (7) The coded part of the message is contained in numbers. For instance, 1755 and 1915 are the first two numbers mentioned in the message. By neglect- ing the lefthand digit in each number and reading the other three digits back- wards, we get from the first number the code number 557 and, from the second, the code number 519. These numbers now indicate the pages in the magazine on which the names corresponding to these numbers are indicated by pin pricks. There are about one hundred and seventy pin pricks scattered throughout the magazine. The question before the experts was whether there were physical signs from which it was possible to deduce whether the writing or the pin pricks, or both, were incorporated in the magazine when it was comparatively new or when it was about fourteen years of age. On this question more than a thousand pages of expert evidence in the form of reports and exhibits were produced before the Commission. As the Commissioners are not experts, the question before the Commission now, as formerly, is whether, from this logomachy, any definite and tangible results may be deduced which will assist the Commission in deciding the question as stated above. The danger here, as in all questions where experts line themselves upon each side, is whether it is possible to detect these cases in which the experts are endeavoring to make the worse appear the better reason. Before considering the specific questions at issue between the two groups of experts, it is well to state some facts which may be gathered from their testimony and seem to be well established. The paper on which the message is written is known as mechanical wood pulp paper, that is to say, it is manufactured from ground wood, or wood fiber. This is a mechanically prepared fiber made by the simple abrasion of a log of wood and the fiber is not subjected to any chemical purification (Heinrich, Ex. 925, p. 5; Hibbert and Minor, Ex. 923, p. 10). The Blue Book magazine of January, 1917, was printed on paper made up of three parts mechanical wood pulp fiber and one part chemical wood pulp fiber, all derived from coniferous wood (Hein- rich, Ex. 925, p. 5). In all mechanical wood pulp fiber paper, resins are present and according to the test made by Dr. Little, resin is present in the paper of Exhibit 904 forming .72% (Little, Ger. Ann. 30, p. 5; Heinrich, Ex. 925, p. 6). On account of the presence of resin, mechanical pulp wood paper is subject to chemical change which may be brought about by exposure to light and air,</p>
<p>432</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>moisture and heat (Hibbert and Minor, Ex. 923, p. 10; Heinrich, Ex. 925, p. 6). The changes which occur in mechanical pulp wood paper after it has been put in magazine form have been classified variously by various experts. Hein- rich classifies them as follows : ( 1 ) Stretching and softening ; (2) Yellowing; and (3) Embrittlement. Brittleness is the increased tendency of a paper to crack on bending and is an important property in considering the question as to the age of the paper (Hibbert and Minor, Ex. 923, p.'20; Heinrich, Ex. 925, pp. 6, 13-15). Neither the stretching and softening of the paper nor the yellowing of the paper indicates deterioration or necessarily age. Pulp wood paper will yellow at an early age if exposed to sunlight and yet the paper, until it does reach the stage of brittle- ness, has not yet come into a deteriorated form (id.). Brittleness is usually the result of the fact that the resins in the wood fibers undergo a hardening such as is observable in ordinary pine trees when the turpentine flowing therefrom becomes hard by exposure to the air and heat. The present condition of Exhibit 904 shows that all the edges have become embrittled and break merely from handling or opening the magazine and the final stage of this brittleness is that the paper will crumble into dust or powder when rubbed between the fingers. A characteristic quality of brittleness in pulp paper is that when it begins to break it will break in straight lines (Heinrich, Ex. 925, p. 14; Hibbert and Minor, Ex. 923, p. 25). The changes in wood pulp paper by deterioration are usually gradual unless subjected to unusual conditions. A copy of the Blue Book Magazine of December, 1916, was filed as Annex 3 to Osborn's first affidavit and copies of the Blue Book Magazine for February, March, April, May, June, and July, 1917, were filed as Annex 4a. A comparison of these magazines with Exhibit 904 shows that while there may be some differences of deterioration among themselves, they are all in much better condition than Exhibit 904. The margins do not break and chip by bending and the corners when bent do not break. It is impossible, however, to say this of Exhibit 904; for the embrittlement has reached such a stage that most of the margins have already broken off, and it wil be recalled that Meyers, when he saw Exhibit 904, said that it was impossible that that book could have been sold from his store in 1931, because of its deteriorated condition. In endeavoring to solve the question before the Commission, the contest between the experts has focused around four points: (1) Whether it is possible from the condition of the one hundred and seventy odd pin pricks to determine the age of the paper when the pin pricks were put through the paper. (2) Whether it is possible, from the perforations and abrasions by the pin, to determine the age of the paper when the message was written thereon. (3) Whether it is possible, from the extent to which the lemon juice has penetrated or struck through the paper, to determine the age of the paper at the time when the writing was imposed thereon. (4) Whether it is possible, from a comparison of the handwriting of Herrmann at or about the time when the message was alleged to have been written in 1917 with his handwriting or at about the time when it was claimed by Germany that he wrote it in 1931, to determine at which time he actually wrote the message. There are some other subordinate inquiries, but, if these are settled, it may be unnecessary to consider the lesser ones. We shall now take up the four questions enumerated above in their order.

<p>433 pricks to determine the age of the paper when the pin pricks were put through the paper? The first expert report introduced by the American Agent was the affidavit of Aloysius J. McGrail (Ex. 904 (1) ), who sustained the authenticity of the instru- ment largely upon the condition of the pin pricks. Osborn, in his original affidavit of December 19, 1931, filed without exhibit number January 9,1932, designated the attempt of McGrail to settle this question by pin pricks as a presumptuous undertaking. Subsequently the American Agent introduced the report of the Bureau of Standards (Ex. 912 (1) ) made by R. E. Lofton, a technician of the Bureau of Standards, the report of Gustavus J. Esselen (Ex. 922), and the report of E. O. Heinrich (Ex. 925), all of which confirmed the report of McGrail ; and the war of the experts had begun. We will endeavor to trace briefly the course of this controversy, but first it is pertinent to give the qualifications of Captain McGrail. At the time of his affidavit Me Grail was a chemist employed by the Ludlow Manufacturing Associates, Ludlow, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard University in chemistry in June, 1913. For three years thereafter he was assist- ant in chemistry at the Catholic University of America, at Washington, D. C , and received in 1916 the degree of Doctor of Philosophy for original work in chemistry. In the spring of 1918 he was recommended by Professor Theodore William Richards of Harvard University, and commissioned as a First Lieutenant in the United States Army for Military Intelligence duty, and, at the time of making his first affidavit, he was a Captain in the Reserve Corps of the Military Intelligence Division of the General Staff. His record during the war is as follows: In 1918 he was assigned to duty at the New York Laboratory of The Postal Censorship Committee where he served until the middle of July, 1918. He was then sent to Washington in charge of the laboratory for secret writing of the Military Intelligence Division of the General Staff and at the time of the Armistice was transferred to Paris for similar duty in connection with secret writing and was there assigned to the American Commission to Negotiate Peace. He continued in Paris until the middle of March, 1919, when he was appointed assistant to the Military Attaché of the American Embassy in Paris where he was placed in charge of the Code Office. He also had supervision over the laboratory for secret writing at the Postal Censorship Bureau in Paris as well as of the laboratory at Advanced General Headquarters at Trier. This assignment continued until October 1, 1919, when he was ordered back to the United States for demobilization. In McGrail's first affidavit of June 28, 1931 (Ex. 904 (1) ), in discussing the subject of pin pricks, his report is as follows (p. 5) : " The secret writing refers to perforations of other pages of the magazine which, for convenience, I shall call pin pricks, though the nature of the instrument used to make the perforations is not determinable. " Inasmuch as the writing refers to pin pricks, which are made a part of the message, the writing must be as old as the pin pricks. I have therefore made a microscopic study of some of the pin pricks, to determine, if possible, whether they are new or old. In my opinion the pin pricks are substantially as old as the maga- zine itself." After examining a great many perforations or pin pricks in the Blue Book magazine of January, 1917 (Ex. 904), and giving their characteristics, he conclu- des his examination as follows (p. 8) : " It is not possible by a microscopic examination to reach a definite conclusion with respect to every pin prick. It is possible that the fibers in the sides of the aper- ture of an old pin prick may not have deteriorated sufficient, or show other positive indications of age, for a positive statement concerning it. On the other hand</p>
<p>434</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>certain of the pin pricks which I have examined do in my opinion afford positive evidences of age. As will be noted from the foregoing analysis, the sides of the apertures of some of these pin pricks, those made through the inked areas of letters, are black. This black is caused by the bending into the aperture of the inked surface fibers. The ink film on these bent surface fibers has not broken, indicating that the ink was comparatively fresh at the time when the punctures were made. In new pin pricks, on old paper, the ink film on surface fibers is usually broken. In the case of new punctures, of course, the ink has become thoroughly dry before the puncture was made, the ink film is brittle, and breaks when the puncture is made. Though this is not a positive test it is one which affords strong evidence. " Others of the pin pricks noted in the foregoing analysis show that the fibers in the sides of the apertures are oxidized to the same extent as the surface of the paper through which the punctures were made. In new pin pricks on old paper the fibers in the sides of the apertures show lighter in color than the surface of the paper through which the punctures are made. " Inasmuch as I was instructed nc not in any way to mar the document submitted to me for examination, I did not make new pin pricks in this document. I did, however, make punctures in a magazine of the same age and paper. My exami- nation of these newly made punctures invariably showed the fibers in the sides of the apertures to be of a lighter color than the surface of the paper; and invariably showed, even where the punctures were made directly through a printed letter, that the film, being now very dry, fractured." In answer to McGrail's affidavit, Osborn, in his original affidavit of December 19, 1931, filed January 9, 1932, treating of the subject of perforations or pin pricks, uses the following language (p. 16): " To attempt to answer a question of this kind, as to whether punctures through printed letters were made five months after the printing or several years after the printing, is in my opinion a presumptuous undertaking. Printing ink is one of the most permanent of substances and does not go through a change within a compa- ratively few years which would furnish the basis for any scientific opinion of this kind. I do not undertake to say that these punctures were made long after the date of the printing, but I do undertake to say that it is impossible to determine the date or approximate date of the puncturing of a letter, printed with ordinary printing ink, if the problem is whether the puncture was made five months after the printing or several years after the printing." (Emphasis supplied.) After a discussion of this matter he says, on p. 17: " I therefore do not undertake to say that these pin-pricks were made either in 1917 or in 1931, and I think that it would be highly dangerous in an important investigation of this kind to depend in the slightest degree upon evidence based upon physical characteristics of this kind." In his second affidavit of May 29, 1932, McGrail, treating of the same subject, used the following language (Ex. 921, p. 21): " I now wish to refer to what I consider to be further strong affirmative evidence of the authenticity of the message. Mr. Osborn and Mr. Clark have been quite free in stating that nothing can be observed from the condition of the pin pricks, although Mr. Osborn has not hesitated to base a ' definite and positive conclusion ' on the authenticity of the magazine upon three very small and doubtful physical phenomena. He has termed my investigation of all the pin pricks in the message (approximately 175 in number) ' presumptuous and highly dangerous in an investi- gation of this kind'. In my original affidavit I enumerated the observations which I had made and specified in some detail the reasons for my conclusions. Both Mr. Osborn and Mr. Clark, supplemented by Mr. Skinner, have denied that any difference can be observed between the condition of a pin prick made at the present time in paper which is fifteen years old and a pin prick made in paper which is of similar quality but approximately five months old. They make other objections to my observations and conclusions which I shall deal with hereafter. Mr. Osborn</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>435 States that in the case of needle or pin pricks in old and new paper ' the physical results of the various perforations are practically the same'. Off-hand, it might appear that an examination of pin pricks is too fine a test to be persuasive — but it is not so. Mr. Osborn, I think, has spoken after a too hasty examination of his own experiments. A careful examination and training in the use of a microscope should enable one to observe the decided differences between pin pricks through old paper and pin pricks through new paper, under proper magnification. Anyone experienced in the use of a microscope knows the difficulties of translating to one who is not used to such an instrument what he sees during an examination of this kind but, with the use of photographs, I hope that this difficulty will be overcome. " In the case of pin pricks made in new paper in the normal manner employed by one pricking out a secret message, the apertures are never sharp. The edge of the aperture is an irregular line. The fibre of new paper is so resilient that within a few hours after the piercing instrument has perforated the paper, fibres or bundles of fibre resembling a flap, spring back into what was approximately their original position and partially close the hole so that the outline of the hole from the reverse is lenticular or in simpler terms is shaped somewhat like a half-moon. The pheno- menon is noticeable both from the obverse and reverse of the aperture. It is rarely seen in pin pricks made today in paper which is of an age corresponding to that of the paper in the Blue Book Magazine of January 1917." After discussing many examples of perforations in the Blue Book magazine of 1917, and some in other magazines, he concludes the discussion as follows (p. 28) : " I have felt it advisable to go into some detail in discussing the condition of the pin pricks and their bearing upon the question at issue, not only because Mr. Osborn and others have referred to my investigation of this phase of the evidence as presumptuous, but also because of my very firm conviction that, given an im- partial and thorough investigation of the pin pricks, the significant characteristics which they, as a whole, possess will become quite apparent. It is true that one pin prick is a very tiny thing, but the question at issue is the age of this document, when certain forces were brought to play upon it ; namely, the pressure of a pen and the perforation by a needle, pin or similar instrument. There are approximately 175 places where the paper was perforated by such an instrument. Is it not natural to suppose that with so many physical phenomena to judge from, there would be some reliable evidence of the reaction of the paper to the forces which were applied to the paper to create these phenomena? With a microscope to enlarge the object and with an ability to interpret what one sees in a microscope, it would certainly appear reasonable to suppose that with so many instances to judge from, quite as much could be learned as from a few small indentations made by a pen. " In page 36 of the joint affidavit of Messrs. Skinner and Clark it is stated that, in their opinion, ' No conclusion can be drawn from the color of the fibres (of paper) when ob- served under the microscope.' " My opinion is quite otherwise. " From the foregoing, I believe the reasons for my opinion as to the authenticity of the document in question are clear, as are also my reasons for believing that many of the conclusions of the experts on behalf of the German Government are absolutely unsound." Under date of June 4, 1932, the Bureau of Standards submitted to the Com- mission Exhibit 921 (1), the report of R. E. Lofton, a technician in the Bureau Standards, on " Pin Pricks in Herrmann message in Blue Book Magazine for January, 1917 ". Lofton had before him McGrail's affidavit of May 29, 1932, and the photomicrographs by McGrail, and reported to the Commission that he had made some additional photomicrographs of the pin pricks in the Blue Book magazine and a microscopic examination of the fiber; that he had read the reports of Hibbert, Minor, Esselen, and McGrail, and then he states : " I agree with the above named experts that there is in general a great difference in the microscopic appearance of pin pricks made in very old, cheap paper and in</p>
<p>436</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>new paper of the same approximate fiber composition, such as that on which the Blue Book Magazine for January 1917, and for June 1932, are printed. This statement is based upon a microscopic examination of the appearances and char- acteristics of pin pricks made by me within the past week in paper from the Blue Book Magazine for January 1917, and from the Blue Book Magazine for June, 1932. " I have found when pin pricks were made in the paper of the Blue Book Magazine for January 1917, that the paper usually breaks abruptly, splits or tears in rather straight lines to form well-shaped angles about the entering pin point or needle point, similar to the manner in which hard, brittle and lifeless rubber, glass or ice usually breaks. On the other hand, pin pricks made in the paper from the current issue of the same magazine showed that the paper or fibers yield gradually before, or are pushed to one side by, the entering point to form holes which are more rounded and are more or less masked by fibers and fiber-bundles which have sprung back into the holes after the point has been removed. This latter condition is one which would logically be expected because of the natural resilience and elasticity of new fibers." He attached to his report two photographs, one showing the appearance of the pin pricks made in the paper from the Blue Book magazine for January, 1917 (furnished him by Mr. Martin), and the second, showing the characteristic appearance of pin pricks made in the Blue Book magazine for June, 1932. He also stated that he had made a thorough examination under the microscope at a magnification of 100 diameters of the pin pricks to be found in the Blue Book magazine for January, 1917 (Ex. 904). He then states his conclusions as follows : " In my opinion, based upon twenty year's experience in the microscopic study of the fiber composition and properties of papers, and upon my observations of pin pricks made in the paper of the two numbers of the Blue Book Magazine referred to above, and of a study of the pin pricks forming a part of the Herrmann message in the Blue Book Magazine for January, 1917, marked 'Exhibit 904', one can, with proper microscopic equipment and training, and a sufficient number of examples, distinguish between pin pricks made in new wood pulp paper and pin pricks made in very old wood pulp paper, such as those in paper as old as that on which the Blue Book Magazine for January, 1917, was printed. " It is also my opinion, based upon my examination of the above mentioned Exhibit 904, and upon my examination of pin pricks in the Blue Book Magazines referred to above, that the pin pricks in such exhibit are characteristic of those which have been made in paper of the wood pulp type when such paper was relatively new." After the filing of Exhibit 921 (1), Osborn filed his affidavit of August 13, 1932 (Ger. Ann. 77, filed August 15, 1932). In this affidavit Osborn refused to distinguish between pin pricks in a new and an old magazine in the following language (p. 35) : " If an opinion is to be based upon this pin-prick evidence alone it would be just as reasonable to say that these pin-pricks in the Blue Book Magazine of January, 1917, were made in March or April, 1931, as in April, 1917." After making this assertion Osborn made a very severe attack upon Lofton's affidavit and accused him of a gross error showing carelessness, or lack of accu- racy in observation, that casts serious doubt upon the report of the witness. In this attack he uses the following language (p. 35) : " Because of its source, the Lofton pin-prick report perhaps deserves special attention. It is in a number of ways a surprising document. In the first place, in illustration of this extraordinary and very doubtful testimony about deter- mining the age of paper by sticking pins through it, this witness presents two photographs of a most peculiar character, about which he says :</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>437 " I have made photo-micrographs by transmitted light at a magnification of 100 diameters to show the characteristic appearance of pin-pricks made in old and in new paper," " That they are made by transmitted light for such a purpose is the first sur- prising fact, if one really desired to show the physical evidence, but still more surprising is the alleged enlargement of 100 diameters,. The photographs filed measure 3.5 inches in width, between the objects farthest apart. If this length is •divided by 100, the information is obtained that the original of this exhibit, if it was enlarged 100 diameters, was less than the size of the interior of the small ' o ' in this typewriting, or .035 of an inch in width. The illustration contains nineteen pin-pricks, which could hardly have been grouped in this small field without interfering with each other. A gross error of this kind shows a carelessness, or lack of accuracy in observation, that casts serious doubt upon any report of this witness. It is of course charitable to say that the inaccurate statement is a blunder, but it is difficult to understand how an error of this kind could be made by an experienced examiner. By mere observation and inspection it should appear that an enlarge- ment of the 100 diameters of a pin-prick would make a large aperture. " Measurements show that the originals of the pin-pricks that I have photo- graphed stereoscopically, 0-29, 0-30 and others, range in size of aperture from about '/«o of an inch to V120 of an inch. It is obvious that a pin-prick of V120 of an inch, enlarged 100 diameters, would show an aperture of one inch. In order to answer the practical purposes for which they are made, pin-pricks would neces- sarily be made large enough so that they would be visible, and it is not probable that a pin-prick of this kind would be made smaller than from 1;s0 to 1/i*a of an inch.'" German Annex 80, dated August 13, 1932. filed August 15. 1932, is the affidavit of Skinner. Clark. Griffin, and Billings. These experts, referring to the photographs made by Lofton, make the same charge as Osborn made, in the following language (p. 27) : " These photographs are misleading, not only because the magnification is wrongly stated, but because they are taken with transmitted light and give no opportunity to see whether the photographs were taken on the printed body of the page or on the unprinted margin." In answer to these criticisms of Lofton's report, the Acting Director of the Bureau of Standards filed Lofton's '" Reply to the criticisms of the German experts relating to my report of a study of pin pricks in the Blue Book Magazine for January, 1917 and of the same magazine for June, 1932 " (Ex. 963 (6) ). In this report Lofton, after quoting the criticisms copied above, stated as follows (p. 3). " The magnification used in making the photomicrographs was 100 diameters, as stated in my report." He then states that after receiving the criticisms he had checked up in order to be doubly sure, on the magnification used, and found it to be as stated in his report. He then describes in detail the methods used by him in making the pin pricks and the photomicrographs, and shows clearly that the criticisms made by Osborn and also by Skinner, Clark, Griffin, and Billings had no basis whatever, and closes his report as follows (p. 10): I should perhaps state, in conclusion, that all the work in connection with the report I made to the Commission and with these comments and photographs was done by me personally. I again state that these results are accurate and that no blunders were made. I, therefore, have no desire to withdraw or modify any statement made in the original report, and this supplementary report is puiely explanatory of the original.'</p>
<p>438</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>Thus we have another example of Osborn's zeal as an investigator, coloring his work as an expert, and leading him to make a baseless and false charge against a scientist in the employment of the Government, devoting his life to the ascertainment of truth, who, in this case, had no interest except to ascertain the facts and report them to the Commission. The report of Gustavus J. Esselen, filed June 1, 1932, fully sustains the report of Captain McGrail on the subject of pin pricks and disposes of the criticisms made by Osborn in this respect. In his report (Ex. 922, p. 33), Esselen says: " In spite of the remarks of Mr. Osborn and Mr. Clark on the question of pin pricks, my study of this matter has clearly shown that there is a very distinct differ- ence between pin pricks made recently in 1917 issues of the Blue Book, as compared with pin pricks made in 1929 or 1931 issues of the Blue Book, particularly if these pin pricks are examined on the reverse side under proper optical conditions. In fact, the exhibits which Mr. Osborn himself has prepared and submitted as Exhibits O-P-l to accompany his Expert Opinion, clearly show these characteristic differences. These differences will be shown hereafter by means of suitable stereo- photographs. In view of my own investigation of this subject, it is my opinion that the pin pricks to be found at several places in the January 1917 issue of the Blue Book which contains the Herrmann message, are characteristic of pin pricks which are made in relatively new paper and are quite distinct in their characteristics from pin pricks which are made in similar paper after it is thirteen or fourteen years old. " In this connection, I would like to invite particular attention to two stereo- photomicrographs which I have taken of Exhibit O-P-l filed by Mr. Osborn with this Expert Opinion. One of these stereo-photomicrographs, Exhibit E-25, shows the reverse side of pin pricks which Mr. Osborn made recently in issues of the Blue Book Magazine for February 1917; the other stereo-photomicrograph, Exhibit E-26, shows the reverse side of pin pricks made by Mr. Osborn at the same time in issues of the Blue Book Magazine for October 1931. While I shall discuss the characteristic differences between these two sets of pin pricks in more detail later on in this report, I will merely invite attention at this time to the fact that the reverse side of the pin pricks made by Mr. Osborn in the recent issues of the Blue Book Magazine show all of the characteristics of the reverse side of the pin pricks in the original message; and furthermore, these characteristics are entirely distinct from those shown by the pin pricks which Mr. Osborn made recently in the old magazines. As illustrative of the reverse side of the pin pricks in the original message, there are filed with this report three stereo-photomicrographs, showing the reverse side of typical pin pricks on various pages of the original message. (Exhibits E-27, E-28, and E-29.) A glance at these will show that they are of the same general character as the pin pricks made by Mr. Osborn recently in fresh paper, indicating that the paper on which the Herrmann message appears was relatively fresh at the time the pin pricks were made in it. This matter is considered in more detail later in this report." Again, after carefully considering the subject and examining a number of pin pricks in Exhibit 904, Esselen concludes his discussion as follows (p. 57) : " I have examined a large number of pin pricks in the original message and the three which are illustrated in Exhibits E-27, E-28 and E-29 are typical of those which I have found in the message itself. In other words, the pin pricks in the magazine containing the Herrmann message are typical of pin pricks made at the time the paper was fresh rather than of pin pricks made after the paper was old. This is an added indication that the magazine was relatively new at the time that the Herrmann message was wiitten in it." Dr. Esselen's qualifications as an expert are as follows : He graduated at Harvard College with the degree of Bachelor of Science, Magna cum Laude in Chemistry, in 1909. He taught chemistry at Harvard and continued his study in the Graduate School, receiving the degree of Master of</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>439 Arts in 1911, and of Doctor of Philosophy in 1912. At the time of making his affidavit he had, for fourteen years, practised as a consulting chemist in many fields of research and specialized in the practical application of chemistry of cellulose, which is the chemical name for fibrous material of which paper is composed. He acted in an advisory capacity for manufacturers of paper, and on two separate occasions made special investigations in Europe in connection with the problems of the Pulp and Paper Industry. He helped translate from German into English Heuser's " Textbook of Cellulose Chemistry " ; prepared the chapter on " Cellulose and its Derivatives " in the book entitled " Colloidal Behavior ", edited by Bogue, and was the author of the chapter on " Cellulose Industries " in " The Manual of Industrial Chemistry ", edited by Rogers. He was a member of the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry, a Coun- cillor-at-Large of the American Chemical Society, a Director of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Surely, with Esselen's support of Lofton, there is no ground for charge that Lofton's opinion was presumptuous and dangerous. Edward O. Heinrich filed Exhibit 925 and eight Annexes, all dealing with Exhibit 904. At the time of filing his Exhibit 925, Heinrich had been for twenty- four years engaged in scientific investigation and microscopy, particularly as applied to police science and the detection of crime. The greater part of his practice had consisted in the examination of disputed documents and hand- writings offered as legal evidence. He has qualified in the courts of a great many states as an expert in chemistry and microscopy, and on all subjects concerning disputed documents and hand- writing. In 1908 he graduated from the University of California with the degree of Bachelor of Science in chemistry. At that institution his work was a study of chemical engineering, with special attention to legal chemistry. He has made himself familiar with all available English, German and French works on the subject of questioned documents and handwriting. He has also made an extensive study of the composition of and method of manufacturing paper. He maintains in Berkeley, California, a fully equipped scientific laboratory for special research in the field of questioned documents, and in the field of micro- chemical analysis. He has been City Chemist of the City of Tacoma, Washington ; Engineer of Tests of the City Tacoma, Washington; Chief of Police of the City of Alameda, California ; Director of Public Safety of the City of Boulder, Colorado, and a Lecturer at the University of California on Criminal Investigation and Disputed Handwritings. Heinrich made an extensive study of the subject of pin pricks in Exhibit 904. He made a number of experiments with new paper of the grade used in Exhibit 904, and with other papers of that grade in various stages of deterioration. He made binocular magnification of the various pin pricks and he used such magni- fication for his study of each one of the 170 pin pricks which he observed in Exhibit 904, and he compared these with the exhibits submitted by Osborn. The result of his study is thus stated (Ex. 925, p. 41) : " I find that the pin pricks in Ex. 904 show the characteristics of pin pricks made in fresh paper. Out of the 170 pin pricks examined, I found less than 2% in which the characteristic phenomena of pin pricks in new paper were not clearly shown. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the pin pricks in Ex. 904 were in- dubitably made at a time when the paper of the magazine was in a comparatively fresh and pliable condition. " My microscopic study of Mr. Osborn's exhibit (his Annex 2, OP-1) disclosed that the pin pricks which he has submitted display the same identifying charac- teristics of youth and age which I have described above."</p>
<p>440</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>And, again, on p. 44. he states as follows: " If I had had but a small number of pin pricks for examination, it would pro- bably have been difficult, if not impossible, for me to reach a positive conclusion. Ex. 904, however, presents so many examples of pin pricks for examination that no one could find it difficult to determine from them a question as to whether the paper was new, or considerably embrittled, at the time when they were made. With so much material available, I have been able to form a positive conclusion that it is impossible that the pin pricks could ha\e been made at any time the paper was in anything like its present condition of embrittlement, or at any time other than when the paper was comparatively fresh." Hibbert and Minor did not make an extended report on the subject of pin pricks but their conclusion is thus indicated (Ex. 923, p. 50): " As this affidavit is already much longer than we would wish to have it, we will not enter into any detailed discussion of the question of the condition of the pin pricks in the original message or Mr. Osborn's comments thereon. Lest our silence on this point be construed, however, as agreement with the statements of the German experts in this regard, we wish to record our view that in our judgment the condition of the pin pricks in the original message bears strong evidence that the paper was fresh when the message was written in the magazine. In this con- nection, we also wish to state that the color of freshly exposed interior fibres in a perforation of paper can, with the proper use of the microscope and in some cases even with the naked eye. be readily observed and distinguished from the coIo: of old, long exposed fibres. The difference of color is particularly noticeable in the case of fresh tears in old surface-yellowed paper and here the naked eye frequently can observe it." In the oral argument at Washington, 1932, page 216, the German Agent simply based his whole argument on pin pricks upon Osborn's experiments and tests and stated that: " he has demonstrated, in our opinion, conclusively that there in no dirTc;ence. We find the same appearance in paper of 1917 as in paper of 1931.'" But the German Agent contended that: " whatever physical evidence there might have been in these pin-piicks that evi- dence was destroyed, whether the pin-pricks were made in 1917 oi in 1931 or at any time in between." On the contrary a careful examination of the stereophotographs which have been prepared and filed by Esselen and those which were prepared and filed by Osborn, himself, will convince even the lay observer that the evidence has not been destroyed and that the distinction which has been observed by McGrail. Lofton, Esselen, and Heinrich is too distinct to be neglected. (2) Is it possible from the perforations and abrasions by the pen to détermine the age of the paper when the message was written thereon? In his original affidavit of December 19, 1931, it was contended by Osborn that the Blue Book magazine of January, 1917, had reached a condition of pronounced deterioration at the edge of the sheets at the time the writing was done, that the paper had softened and weakened at the edge of the sheets to such' an extent, and that the deterioration of the paper at the edges had progressed so far, that when the writer came to the edge of the sheet " as shown in two places at the edges on page 698 and page 694, the two nibs of the pen actually stuck through the paper " (p. 5). The first instance given by Osborn of the nibs sticking through the paper was on page 698 in connection with the word " bunch " and he claimed that the ink actually went through the hole and discolored even the last page of the message which wa.-&gt; 694 and was the second sheet under 698.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>441 The second instance of perforation, noted by Osborn. was in the figure 6 on the second line of the writing on page 698. The third instance is in the letter " s " in the word " greetings " in the last line on page 694. Then Osborn goes on as follows, page 6: " On both of these pages other writing near at hand, not on the edge of the sheet, shows that the paper was not softened and weakened in the middle of the sheet but only near the edge. On these portions of the sheets not a single instance is found where the pen either cut, or stuck through, the pnpe&gt;." (Emphasis supplied.) In the joint affidavit of Skinner and Clark, dated January 26, 1932, German Annex 25, we find the following at page 37: " Upon our examination of the original January 1917 copy of the Blue Book Magazine, we find that the writing on the bottom margin of the pages shows at five different places punctures of the sheet or ruptures of the surface fibers by the pen point; whereas no similar puncturing of the surface fibei s is shown in the body of the page, proving that the paper must have been written on when the margin of the pages had already become deteriorated by natural ageing." (Emphasis supplied.) Thus we have Osborn charging that " on these pages not a single instance is found where the pen either cut or stuck through the paper ", when the writing is " not on the edge of the sheet "; and Skinner and Clark echoing this charge when they say that " ' no similar punc turing of the shee t or rupturing of the surface fibers is shown in the body of the page, proving that the paper must have been written on when the margin of the pages had already become deteriorated by natural ageing." In response to these charges, that there were no punctures or pen cuts in the body of the sheets or through the pages, Heinrich, examining the same instru- ment, reports in his affidavit of May 31, 1932 (Ex. 925, p. 29), that he found five pen punctures (complete perforations and fifteen pen-digs (almost complete perforations), in the central areas of the pages, that is, elsewhere than in the margins. The location of the punctures ar set out by Heinrich as follows (p. 29) : Punctured at foot. Punctured on upper left side. Punctured on up stroke of lower loop. Punctured on up stroke of lower loop. Punctured on up stroke opposite turning movement closing base of letter ". In German Annex 77, Osborn's affidavit of August 13, 1932, referring evident- ly to the claim as set out above by Heinrich, he says, p. 13: " This Heinrich report also admits that the pen of the writer of the message actually perforated the paper at the margin in three places, and then contends that the same quality and character of perforations are found in the middle of the pages. This is not the fact. A careful microscopic examination discloses that at least most of the alleged defects in the center of the sheet were not caused by the pen but were in the paper itself, as they are in other sheets. There is such a defect on page 694 between the first and second lines, under the word ' to '." (Emphasis in original.) As reported by Esselen in his affidavit dated May 28, 1932, Exhibit 922, page 42, there are two pronounced punctures made by the pen in writing in the following places: On page 698 there is an obvious cut in the letter " g " in the word " go " in the fifth line of the message. This cut can be viewed by the naked eye and is " Page 700 698 698 698 694 Line 4 1 n3</p>

<p>clearly shown in the stereophotograph made by Esselen and filed with his report as Ex. E-8. The reverse or underside of the hole is also shown in separate stereo- photograph Ex. E-8a. On page 700 the pen made an actual hole in writing the letter " n " in the word " and " in the fourth line of the message. Esselen's stereophotograph E- 11 brings out the hole clearly and the stereophotograph E-l la exhibits the hole on the reverse side of page 699 of the message. Both of these holes, however, can be seen plainly with the naked eye. The other stereophotographs filed by Esselen with his report give a number of examples where the pen either pierced the paper or made deep indentations as follows :</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-1"><span class="para-num">1.</span><p>On page 694 the final " s " in the word " funds " shows that the pen made a deep dig into the paper followed by a skip before the writing started again.</p></div>

In this case the pen stuck into the paper, then interrupted, and then started again. In all three of these last cases the stereophotographs show clearly the deep indentations. (3) Is it possible from the extent to which the lemon juice has penetrated or struck through the paper to determine the age of the paper at the time when the writing was imposed thereon? On this question the experts are in direct opposition. In Osborn's first affidavit of December 19, 1931, filed January 9, 1932, he reports as follows (p. 2) : " The writing on the four pages of the Blue Book Magazine of January, 1917, appearing on pages 700, 698, 696 and 694, was in my opinion written a number of years after its alleged date of April, 1917. My opinion is based on the fact that the paper was old when the writing was done. These pages show in the writing itself unmistakable physical evidence that there was a pronounced difference, when the writing was done, in the condition of the paper at the edge of the sheet as compared with the middle of the sheets. This changed condition in wood pulp paper is positive evidence of age." paper is positive evidence oi ag&lt; And again on page 5 he says: " The Blue Book Magazine i "The Blue Book Magazine of January, 1917, in which the disputed writing appears on the four pages, in my opinion, had undoubtedly reached a condition of pronounced deterioration at the edges of the sheets at the time the writing was done. This paper in this January, 1917, magazine, when the writing was done, had softened and weakened at the edges of the sheets to such an extent, that is, the deterioration of the paper at the edges of the sheets had already so far pro- gressed, that when the writer came to the edge of the sheet, as shown in two places at the edges on page 698 and page 694, the two nibs of the pen actually stuck through the paper. On page 698 where the word ' bunch ' appears the pen actually cut the paper and the ink ran through to the page underneath which, as the magazine was lying, was page 696. and there is some indication on the earliest photostatic photographs (See Ex. 904, 2c, and 904, 3a) that the ink actually went through and discolored even the last page of the message, which was 694 and was the second sheet under 698 where the word ' bunch ' appears." In his affidavit of December 21, 1931, filed on the same day as Osborn's first affidavit, January 9, 1932, Frederic C. Clark, one of the German experts, after giving the composition of the paper used in Exhibit 904 and stating that " de- composition is the result of the action of sunlight, air and certain gases ", then</p></div>

<p>443 states that this deterioration is first recognized as a slight discoloration of a brownish color, then this brownish color deepens and finally it results in the fiber crumbling into a dustlike material. He then states as follows (Ann. 10 to Osborn's Opinion, p. 6) : " A paper composed largely of ground-wood pulp may show good writing quali- ties with pen and ink while the paper is relatively new. As deterioration sets in, however, and the paper becomes actually brittle, it then shows very poor writing qualities with pen and ink, as the pen points may actually tear the paper even with slight pressure, and the ink tends to go through the paper more readily where deterioration has taken place. If badly deteriorated, a ground-wood paper may be so absorbent to ink as to carry the ink all the way through the paper, staining the opposite side, very much as in the case in writing on a piece of thin blotting paper. The rapid absorption of ink where the paper is badly deteriorated is due to the fact that in the deterioration set up, the ground wood fibers lose their fibrous form and are reduced to a dustlike material, and this dustlike material more rapidly absorbs ink from a pen than occurs where the fibers show no or very light evidence of deterioration. " Again at page 13 he said: " Based upon the evidence presented above and my knowledge of ground-wood papers, it is my opinion that the paper used in the above mentioned copies of the Blue Book Magazine of an age of two years could be written on with pen and ink at the unprinted margin without tearing or roughening up of the surface and without penetration of the ink through the paper, such as occurs when discoloration and embrittlement have reached an appreciable degree. It is my further opinion that with the paper used in the Blue Book Magazine, the tendency to deteriorate will progressively increase so that with paper as old as that used in the 1917 Blue Book Magazine, it would be difficult if not impossible to write on it with ink and particularly with a heavy pen stroke at the margin of the paper without a marked roughening up of the surface and penetration of ink through the paper." A comparison of Osborn's first affidavit and Clark's affidavit will show clearly that the latter was filed to substantiate the former in the statements made and quoted above. It is pertinent to note that at the time when Clark made his affidavit he had not even seen Exhibit 904 about which he was testifying. In opposition to the view expressed by Osborn and Clark, is the affidavit of Charles J.J. Fox (Ex. 919). Charles James John Fox at the time of making his affidavit was a doctor of Philosophy and a Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland. From 1897 to 1901 he studied at University College, London, under Sir William Ramsay and Professor F. G. Donnan. During 1901 he studied at the University of Paris. From 1902 to 1904 he studied at the Universities of Leipzig, Breslau and Berlin. From 1904 to 1907 he was a member of the staff of the Chemistry Department of University College, London, and cooperated with Professor Fridtjof Nansen in Oceanographical research. From 1907 to 1914 he was Professor of Chemistry at the College of Engineering, Poona, India. During the World War he was Major, Royal Artillery, engaged in munition work and for a time a member of the General Staff of the Army Department. From 1919 to 1925 he was Principal and Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institute of Science, Bombay. Since 1925 he had been a partner in the firm of Cross and Bevan, consulting and analytical chemists, London, specializing in the Cellulose Industries. He is the author of various scientific and technical memoirs and monographs, including articles in the Encyclopedia Britannica on Cellulose, Rayon and Paper, and also in Thorpe's Dictionary of Applied Chem- istry, new edition. Fox in his affidavit (Ex. 919, dated May 20, 1932, filed June 1, 1932) exam- ined the contention of Osborn (p. 6) and of Skinner and Clark (p. 7) and of</p>

<p>Little (p. 71, all of whom came to the conclusion expressed by Osborn that the paper of the sheets containing the Herrmann message " had undoubtedly reached a condition of pronounced deterioration at the edges of the sheets at the time the writing was done ". He also examined the contentions made by Clark in Annex 10 to Osborn's Expert Opinion, p. 8, and summarized the conclusions of the affidavits filed on behalf of Germany as follows (p. 9) : " 6. Broadly summarized, the conclusions of these affidavits filed on behalf of the Germans as I understand them are as follows: " (1) That wood pulp paper of the kind used in the Blue Book Magazine de- teriorates with age, the deterioration manifesting itself in a progressive bi owning and embrittlement beginning at the edges of the pages and spreading inwards towards the middle of the pages. " (2) That this deterioration is slow in • normal ' conditions of handling and storage, such as in a library, with the consequence that a number of years elapse before there is any serious deterioration sufficient to affect writing quality. " (3) That the writing quality of the paper when new and undeteriorated is better than when old and deteriorated and particularly is it better at the edges of the paper. " (4) That since the inscription in the Blue Book Magazine of January, 1917, displays signs of difficulty in writing especially at the edges of the paper, such difficulty being indicated by roughening, penetration and such like effects on the paper, visible mainly at the edges of the paper but not in the middle, therefore the paper was some years old at the time the inscription was written and conse- quently older than the twenty-one weeks between the date of the Magazine's being; printed and April, 1917." After discussing the subject of deterioration of paper showing the different conditions and factors which make for deterioration. Fox then discusses the subject of" Evidence of absorption and penetration " (p. 16) and shows clearly that wood pulp paper is more absorbent when comparatively young than it is when it grows old; that on account of progressive hardening of the resin ingre- dient of ground wood in wood pulp paper, its writing quality improves with age and its absorbent quality decreases. In this connection he made some experiments with the time of penetration of lemon juice into magazine papers at different ages and reports his results as follows (p. 21): " Time of Penetration of Lemon Juice into magazine papers of different ages. (See Exhibits XXXIII to XXXVIII hereto inclusive) Thickness 1/1000 Times measured Magazines Tested Inch on different pages Blue Book, March 1917 5.85 j 90 minutes 116 minutes Adventure.

<p>J ' ( 20 seconds 20 seconds Adventure, 15 April. 1932 5.15 S J minutes 10 minutes 1 ( 48 seconds 19 seconds . After making this table Fox says : " Any observer of these exhibits will be able to notice that the lemon juice has spread to a much larger area on the new paper of the 1932 issue than it has on the old paper of the two 1917 issues." An examination of Exhibits XXXIII to XLb, filed with Fox' affidavit, verifies his conclusions.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>445 After a careful and scientific treatment of the subject, a part of his conclusion is stated as follows (p. 25) : " It follows from this, by easy deduction, that blurring, feathering and penetra- tion of the writing fluid are, in ray opinion, more likely to happen with new paper than with old. Therefore, it is my belief, also, that the inscription with lemon juice in the Blue Book Magazine of January, 1917, was written when the paper was new and easily wetted, and easily penetrated because easily wetted. The blurring and feathering of the writing and the penetration of the paper at some places at the edges and towards the middle of the page alike, are much more likely evidence of the difficulty of writing on new paper than evidence that, at such places, the paper may have been weak, because old, at the time of its being written upon. It follows also, and it is my opinion, that the giving way of the paper at the edges is merely the effect of age, and such giving away must sometimes happen to occur where there happens also to be some writing near by. It is my opinion that this fact, in itself, cannot be accepted as evidence that the paper was old when the inscription was written. However that may be, the inscribing of the word • bunch ' on Page 698 was very evidently completed quite satisfactorily at the time it was written, and the final ' h ' shows signs of blurring or feathering, which, in my opinion, is evidence that the page was relatively new and undeteriorated at that edge at the time it was written. This opinion is strengthened by the circum- stance that there appears to have been penetration of the writing fluid into the two pages below, which I believe was the more likely to have occurred if the paper was relatively new at the time of writing than if it was old, though penetration, even then, is no doubt also always dependent, to some extent, upon the stiffness and sharpness of the pen and the skill of the writer, including the speed at which he writes. If and when deterioration at the edge of the pages does ultimately set in so that the paper there gives way in consequence of increase of brittleness, it is to be expected that it will give way more easily where the pen has indented it and deposited upon it an acid substance (citric acid) which has a markedly deteriorating action." After Fox' affidavit (Ex. 919) had been filed the joint affidavit of Skinner, Clark, Griffin, and Billings, consisting of 144 pages, dated August 13, 1932, was filed on August 15, 1932. One of the chief purposes this affidavit was to discredit Fox' affidavit; and for this purpose they say (p. 71): " All of the data furnished by Fox on rate of penetration in old and in new paper contributes nothing that is not well known. He goes to great length to prove that new paper has a higher rate of penetrability than old paper. In the disputed message there is no appreciable strike-through of the writing except on the first page, and even there the strike-through occurs only where it is clearly evident that an abnormal and excessive amount of writing fluid was applied to the paper. If Fox had actually seen the reverse side of the pages on which the message was written, instead of reproductions of the written side only, and had applied the results of his tests to the question at issue, his only logical conclusion would have been that the paper was old when the message was written." (Ger. Ann. 80.) In making these statements these four experts were jointly guilty of several egregious errors. First, they assert that there is no appreciable strike-through of the writing except on the first page, and even there the strike-through occurs onh/ where it is clearly evident that an abnormal and excessive amount of writing fluid was applied to the paper. An examination of the pages in Exhibit 904 on which the message was written and of the reverse pages, shows that there is an appreciable strike-through on every page. These four experts also say that, if Fox had actually seen the reverse side of the pages on which the message was written, instead of copies of the written</p>
<p>446</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>side only, and had applied the results of his tests to the question at issue, his only logical conclusion would have been that the paper was old when the message was written. Fox filed, with his Exhibit 919, Annex A which contained photographic Ex- hibits I to XLb. I and II are photographs of page 700 and page 699 of the Herr- mann message, page 700 being the page on which the first page of the message occurs and page 699 being the reverse page. Even in this photograph it is easy to see that the strikes-through occur not only where there is an abnormal amount of the fluid but also where there is a normal amount of fluid. Exhibit III is a photograph of page 698 and Exhibit IV is a photograph of page 697. Page 698 contains the second page of the message and 697 is the reverse side of page 698. An examination of the photograph of 697 as well as of the original, shows also many examples of strikes-through which are observed even in the photograph. Exhibit V is a photograph of page 696 and Exhibit VI is a photograph of page 695. In these pages the same phenomena appear as in the prior ones. Exhibit VII is a photograph of page 694 and Exhibit VIII is a photograph of page 693. The strikes-through here are evident and numerous. Page 694 is the last page of the Herrmann message and page 693 is the reverse page, and, on this reverse page, there are evident many cases of strikes-through where the use of the liquid is normal. In fact, there is no abnormal use of the liquid on page 694 and only one on page 696 and no abnormal liquid on page 698, and yet, every one of these cases, there are strikes-through evident on the photographs as well as on the original Exhibit 904. William J. Hurst, a graduate of Pratt Institute in the Department of Chemis- try, post-graduate in Organic Chemistry at the Polytechnic Institute of Brook- lyn, N. Y., where he obtained the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry, and who also took a post-graduate course in Coal Tar Dye Chemistry at Columbia University, was at the time of his affidavit chief chemist for S. S. Stafford, Inc., manufacturers of writing inks, typewriter ribbons and carbon papers. He had qualified as an expert examiner of questioned documents in Federal and State courts in New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. He made an expert report on Exhibit 904, which was filed on June 1, 1932, as Exhibit 924. After an examination of Exhibit 904 his report on the instrument contained the following (p. 2) : The writings on the pages of the imposed message show spreadings similar to known effects of writing on fresh paper of the wood pulp magazine type. On the reverse side of these pages, i. e., on pages 699, 697, 695 and 693 evidences of the penetration is markedly shown and the absorption of ink by new paper and the penetration of ink in the fibers of new paper and the seeping through the fibers to the back or the reverse of new paper is clearly shown. The extent of the penetration can be readily observed by anyone who examines the original document or photographs of the reverse of the pages on which the message has been written. " In the original message the nature of the blurs on page 700 is particularly significant. The blurs are approximately the same size on the reverse as on the obverse of the page and both the obverse and the reverse show that the paper was fresh at the time of the writing and that the writing was done before the pro- nounced natural resistance to penetration due to substantial ageing had set in. Furthermore, the blurring, feathering and absorption of the writing, when any substantial amount of lemon juice was on the pen, is a most significant indication of the freshness of the page at the time the writing was done. The extent to which the writing itself penetrated the paper which, when compared with the decided</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>447 resistance of old paper to the penetration of writing gives further evidence of the freshness of the page at the time of writing. I made a microscopic examination of the original message and found the book to be of a yellowish brown appearance, which is characteristic of aged paper, particularly of the wood pulp magazine quality. On the outer edges of the pages there is a darker coloration, more brownish in hue, and this prevails throughout the entire magazine, particularly at (he bottom edges. This brownish edging is also characteristic of aged paper and is produced by atmospheric contact, which has an action similar to that of the mid- summer's sun or ultra-violet rays. This action is more rapid on wood pulp papers which are the types generally used for cheap magazines and newspapers. " On pages 700, 698, 696 and 694 I particularly noticed that on the bottom of the pages (the page-numbered end) the pages appear brittle, and in these cases the edge was cracked and pieced out. It is my opinion that the pages were affected by the application of the hot iron which dried the paper and the ageing, due to contact with the atmosphere, has caused the hardening and brittleness of the edges. " Conclusion: From an application of well known principles respecting the rela- tive penetration of ink through fresh and aged paper to the condition of the original message, it is, in my judgment, conclusively shown that the message was drafted in the magazine when the magazine paper was comparatively new and fresh. The points which prove this are the spreading of the writing on the paper, the pene- tration and absorption of the lemon juice through the fiber of the paper, and the extent of the penetration as shown on the reverse sides of the written pages. If the writing had been done on old paper, with no heavier stroke than employed by the writer of the original message, there would not have been such a tendency of the lemon juice to spread or to penetrate through the fiber of the paper to the reverse side. This tendency of writing fluid to penetrate new paper is clearly observable in any examination of writing on fresh paper of this type and it harmonizes com- pletely with the action of the writings in the original message. On the other hand, writing on old paper of this type has a tendency to be compact, non-spreading and strongly resistant to the penetration to the reverse side. Another corroborating point, in my judgment, is the brittleness of the paper at the edges. Whereas the whole written pages had the application of a heated iron to develop the invisible ink, the brittleness does not extend to the entire message, but is restricted to the edges. It is my opinion that the hot iron was used many years ago and that the action of the atmosphere upon the edges of the paper created this pronounced brittleness. In other words, the early drying up of the moisture on the paper prepared the way for a pronounced brittleness of the edges through atmospheric contact with the lapse of time." In order to establish whether the message was written in April, 1917, or around about April, 1931, the affidavit of Gerald Francis Gurrin was introduced. The same affidavit contained the data from which it was clearly established that the plus signs in the table of contents of the Blue Book Magazine of January, 1917 (Ex. 904), were made in exactly the opposite sequence which the Quakers brothers were accustomed to use in marking the titles to articles read by them. At the time of making his affidavit (Ex. 918), Gerald Francis Gurrin was practicing his profession as " a Handwriting Specialist and Examiner of Ques- tioned Documents ". Gurrin had made a special study of the subject of hand- writing and everything appertaining to disputed and forged documents for the past 28 years. In his professional work he had been consulted by His Britannic Majesty's Treasury (Director of Public Prosecutions), Admiralty, War Office and most of the Government Departments, as well as by the Criminal Investiga- tion Department, Scotland Yard, City of London Police, County Police Forces of England and Wales, the Bank of England, and the principal Joint Stock Banks. He had been accepted and recognized as an expert witness on matters concerning disputed handwriting and documents in the Supreme Courts of the British Isles, in civil and criminal cases, as well as in Naval and Military Courts Martial.</p>
<p>418</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>After reading the various expert affidavits already on file he came to the conclusion that the matter was not one which a handwriting specialist was best qualified to decide, since it involved questions which only a trained analytical chemist could pass upon, and, therefore, he referred the matter to Dr. C. J. J. Fox, and Dr. Fox's affidavit was produced as the result of this reference. In Exhibit 967, Gurrin filed an affidavit which dealt with certain questions affecting the Herrmann message. The question which he endeavored to answer was as follows (p. 9) : " Whether there is evidence in this message sufficient to establish either that it was written in April 1917 or at a much later date; namely, sometime in 1930 or 1931." In discussing this question he said (p. 10): '" From my own experience, confirmed by experiments made for the purpose of this case, I know that on the application of a non-viscous fluid to new wood pulp paper absorption is very speedy, commencing to spread around the spot to which it is applied immediately on application. If the liquid is applied with a pen, the spreading takes place beyond the area defined by the tracks of the pen. Absorp- tion, of course, also takes place downwards into the fibres of the paper and be- comes visible on the back of the sheet if the paper is turned over after the short space of time required to write two short words. This fact can be tested in an elementary way by the dipping of a feather into lemon juice and the application of a tiny spot to a piece of new paper of the type in question. Immediately the spot is on the paper an area of dampness in the form of a halo appears around the spot. If the paper is turned over, it will be seen that the dampness appears on the reverse side practically at once. " I further know that as wood pulp paper ages it becomes harder and less ab- sorptive. In this conditon the writing fluid is not absorbed quickly. It does not flow out laterally from the pen, but is confined roughly to the area marked by the writing instrument, much in the same way as though the writing were being effected upon a sized paper. If the elementary test of the drop of liquid is applied, absorption does not give the immediate effect of a halo around the spot, but the liquid is confined to its original area for a considerable time, sometimes even for the whole period of the drying process. Further, the liquid is not visible at once upon the back of the paper." Gurrin's findings were as follows (p. 11) : " With these conditions in mind, I have examined the message commencing on page 700 of Exhibit 904. I find " (a) That the writing fluid has run out laterally from the pen, sometimes to a considerable extent, normally beyond the pen tracks and only being confined to the pen tracks when the amount of liquid on the pen was failing. "' (b) That absorption has taken place to the extent of making the writing visible on the reverse sides of the pages. " (c) The lateral spreading of the fluid occurs to its greatest extent at the be- ginning of the message. This does not, I think, result from increased absorbency at that point. It is a condition frequently found in invisible writing and is often due to the fact that it is difficult to appreciate when writing with a colorless or almost colorless liquid whether or not too much of the fluid is contained in the pen." (Emphasis supplied.) After discussing the subject of visibility of the writing upon the back of the paper and the pen punctures in the margin. Gurrin then states as follows (p. 13) : " Reviewing the facts, bearing upon the age of this message, we have " (a) Spreading of the writing fluid laterally beyond the pen stroke; " (b) Absorption into and through the paper to the extent of visibility and, in parts, legibility on the reverse sides of the pages; and " (c) Absence of increased spreading or puncturing towards the edge of the paper."</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>449 And then he states as follows: " In my judgment, (a) and (b) constitute affirmative evidence of the fact that the message was written when the paper was relatively new, whereas (c) is negative evidence in the sense that it shows that there was no appreciable disparity between the condition of the margins of the pages and the centers of the pages when the message was written. " On considering the value of these facts, taken together, I feel that all are in- consistent with writing an old paper. Furthermore, I can find no facts which are consistent with writing upon old paper. In these circumstances I think it is a reasonable and sound deduction that the paper was in comparatively new con- dition when the writing fluid was applied and, certainly, far younger than 14 years old." Esselen, treating the subject of deterioration of wood pulp paper and the comparative writing surfaces presented by old paper and by new paper, files as Exhibit E-31 with his exhibit, six pages, one from a March, 1916, Blue Book; one from a January, 1917; another from a September, 1917, and a fourth from an April, 1918, Blue Book. He also filed a page each from a May, 1930, issue of the Blue Book magazine, and a February, 1932, issue of Ranch Romances. The writing on all of these pages was done in as nearly the same manner as was possible for him to perform the experiment. He describes the result of his ex- periments as follows (Ex. 922, p. 19): " I wish, however, to invite particular attention to two things in connection with the resulting writing. The first is that there is practically no tendency for the lemon juice marks to spread or feather on the old paper, whereas on the more recent paper, there is a very distinct tendency for the lines to blur. In the second place u will be noticed that in no case has the iemon juice penetrated the paper of the 1916. 1917 or 1918 Blue Books, whereas there is considerable penetration shown on the paper from the more recent issues." Again, referring to the same subject matter, Esselen says (p. 32) : " The manner in which the lemon juice writing penetrated through the paper in a large number of places on all four pages of the message as is indicated by the photographs of both the obverse and reverse sides of these pages (Exhibit E-38a- h-Photographs taken March 8, 1932), as well as the manner of penetration, is further indication that the paper was not old at the time that the message was written on it." And, again, on p. 52, he states as follows: " While I am aware of rare cases where lemon juice writing has penetrated old paper contrary to the general tendency, nevertheless in such cases, the feathering and blurring which is characteristic of the penetration on fresh paper was not noticeable. A glance at the Herrmann message, for example, page 700, and the reverse side, page 699, immediately shows that the writing not merely penetrated, bat that it blurred in a manner characteristic of fresh paper on which writing is imposed. The tendency for lemon juice writing to penetrate fresh paper and not to penetrate old paper is also well illustrated in Exhibits S. &amp; S. # 1, $2, # 3 . # 4 , # 5 , # 6: #6, #7, and # 8 which were filed with the joint affidavit of Messrs Skinner and Clark (Annex /5 to Mr. Osborn's Expert Opinion). Photo- giaphs of the obverse and reverse of each of these exhibits are filed with this repoit as Exhibits E-39a-39n inclusive. These photographs were taken on March 28,</p>

<p>pages from the February 1917 or December 1917 issues of the Blue Book Magazine show any signs of penetration of the writing, whereas all four of the pages from the July and August 1931 issues of the Blue Book Magazine show that the lemon juice writing has penetrated through the paper. In my opinion, these facts are further indication that the January 1917 Blue Book used for the Herrmann message was not old at the time that the message was written in it." Hibbert and Minor made a most careful and scientific analysis of the physical characteristics of Exhibit 904 and an examination of the affidavits of McGrail, Osborn, Herrmann, Hilken, Stein, Skinner and Clark, and Little, and present their conclusion as follows (Ex. 923, filed June 1, 1932, p. 3): " The conclusion we have reached after a careful study of each of these affidavits and of the document, and after an extensive investigation extending over three months, into the physical and chemical properties of cheap magazine papers such as have been used in the Blue Book and similar magazines covering the period 1916-1932, is that the secret message in question, found in the January, 1917 copy of the Blue Book could not have been written within the last two or three years. " The experimental evidence obtained by us indicates clearly that the message was written while the paper was relatively new, that is, within a period of less than two to three years after the issue of the magazine." In the course of their report, they made a careful study of the causes bringing about changes and deterioration of paper, applied their studies to issues of the Blue Book magazine for the period 1916-1932. reviewed the testimony of the experts for Germany, and in the course of their report discussed the evidence submitted by Osborn in part as follows (p. 47) :</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">"V. DISCUSSION OF EVIDENCE SUBMITTED PREVIOUSLY BY</h3>
<h3 class="doc-h3">MR. ALBERT S. OSBORN</h3>
<p>" A careful examination of the evidence submitted by Mr. Albert S. Osborn as to the actual date of the writing of the message in the January, 1917, Blue Book shows his conclusions are based almost entirely on a certain assumption relating to the properties of paper, and the changes which paper undergoes with age. " He states (page 2) : " ' The writing on the four pages of the Blue Book Magazine of January, 1917, appearing on pages 700, 698, 696 and 694, was in my opinion written a number of years after its alleged date of April, 1917. My opinion is based on the fact that the paper was old when the writing was done. These pages show in the writing itself unmistakable physical evidence that there was a pronounced difference, when the writing was done, in the condition of the paper at the edge of the sheets as compared with the middle of the sheets. This changed condition in wood pulp paper is positive evidence of age.' " And then they say: " On what does he base ' this unmistakable physical evidence '? " They assert that Osborn's evidence for this is the existence of certain paper perforations discovered in the Herrmann message, and they quote Osborn's conclusion as to these perforations (pp. 5 and 6) heretofore quoted in this opinion. Hibbert and Minor then resume (p. 49) : " Mr. Osborn had before him, in the Blue Book in question, an obviously very badly deteriorated magazine, and one characterized by a very pronounced brit- tleness of the outer margins of its pages. " This paper had certain distinguishing characteristics which made it highly susceptible to atmospheric conditions such as light, air, heat and moisture. " It had been stored for many years under unidentifiable conditions; had been inscribed with an acid writing fluid known to bring about deterioration of paper with age; had been subjected to the action of an abnormally high temperature at</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>451 the time the message was developed, and thereafter again exposed to sundry influ- ences. Each of these factors could h;ive exerted a profound influence on the paper, as demonstrated in the extensive series of tests carried out by us, and a realization of this fact alone should have called for the greatest caution on the part of Mr. Osborn in drawing conclusions based exclusively on a visual and microscopic inspection of the edges of the magazine. " In view of our results, it is most reasonable to suppose that at least some of the perforations noticed by Mr. Osborn did not exist at the time the message was written. It is highly probable that during the writing of the message, certain spots of high lemon juice concentration, together with a thin compact fiber surface were developed, and that under the influence of a abnormally high temperature (occur- ring during the development of the message) and after a considerable period of time, very friable spots were formed. Due to repeated handling of the pages of the magazine, fracture then took place at these places. Cf. our Table IV, the word ' with ' in page 698 of the message and the numeral 5 on page 696. (See page 31 of this affidavit.) " This tendency, together with the existence of clear evidence of punctures in the middle of the pages which with much greater basis than is present in the case of Mr. Osborn's examples, can be called actual pen punctures, leaves Mr. Osborn with no real foundation for his opinion. " As to the word ' bunch ' appearing on page 698 of the message, we believe our experiments as shown in Section V of our series of exhibits, when examined with our Table IV, show exactly what took place. The fact that the lemon juice pene- trated through not only to the reverse page but also to the next lower page, is in our judgment one of the most convincing indications, among a number, that the paper was fresh when the writing occurred. With the decided resistance of old paper to any penetration, even to the reverse page, the penetration to the next lower page of the ' h ' in this word, as shown by the early photographs of the mes- sage is most eloquent of the newness of the page at the time of writing."

<p>general paper problems, and is a member of the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry. The Herrmann message, Exhibit 904, was submitted to Admiral Sir William Reginald Hall, who was Director of Naval Intelligence of Great Britain from October, 1914, until February, 1919. In that position he had occasion to handle a great number of messages written by German agents which were intercepted by the British authorities during the World War and also employed similar systems of communication. During that time his organization intercepted and deciphered and decoded upwards of 15,000 German secret communications in the form of cablegrams, radiograms, invisible writings and other code, cipher or other secret communications, and this number does not include the work of the British Censor's office. Among other messages intercepted by him was the famous Eckardt to General Staff telegram so often quoted in this record, verifying Herrmann's authority to destroy the Tampico oil fields. The intercepted telegrams which are in this record were the product of Admiral Hall's organization. In a letter to President Wilson dated March 17, 1918, Walter Hines Page, Ambassador to Great Britain, thus describes Admiral Hall (Hendrick, Life and Letters of Walter H. Page Vol. 3, p. 361) : " Hall is one genius that the war has developed. Neither in fiction nor in fact can you find any such man to match him. Of the wonderful things that I know he has done, there are several that it would take an exciting volume to tell. The man is a genius — a clear case of genius. All other secret service men are amateurs by comparison." After an examination of the Blue Book message, Hall reported his conclusion as follows (Ex. 920): " I am unreservedly satisfied that the message contained in the Blue Book Maga- zine for January, 1917, is genuine and that it was written when it purports to have been written, to-wit, early in the year 1917 in an invisible fluid, and developed by heat shortly after. There can be, in my opinion, no reasonable doubt on this subject. " In reaching this conclusion the experiments of the experts who testified for Germany regarding the characteristics of the paper have confirmed in no small measure my opinion that the message was written in 1917, for their experiments of writing with lemon juice on paper of different ages illustrate a simple fact which I think is reasonably well known. I am quite sure that the original writing in the original message filed with the Commission was placed upon the magazine when the paper was in a green or fresh condition and not after the paper had become seasoned and less subject to the penetrating action of liquids. An examination of the pages of the original message through a microscope shows that the marks on the reverse of each page of writing come from the fluid soaking through the paper. A similar seepage of liquid shows in the experiments of the experts upon similar paper of recent manufacture, but it does not show to the same extent, if at all when writing is now placed on paper that has already become crisp with age." While Admiral Hall does not attempt to qualify as an expert on paper or ink, his opinion deserves attention since it is confirmed by the greatest experts in the world on the point which Hall discussed and the experience which he had had in intercepting, deciphering and decoding secret communications enabled him to take the expert opinions and come to a definite conclusion thereon. An examination has been made of the claim of the experts for Germany that the heel marks left by the iron indicate that the yellowing of the margins had occurred before the iron was applied, and therefore that the paper was old before the writing was imposed upon the paper (Ger. Ann. 25; Ger. Ann. 80). The fallacy of this argument has been clearly exposed by Fox (Ex. 919, pp. 27, 28).</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>453 as well as by the experiments of Esselen (Ex. 922, pp. 48-52); ofHibbert and Minor (Ex. 923, pp. 45-47) ; and by Heinrich (Ex. 923, pp. 20 et seq.). Indeed, an examination of Exhibit 904 would seem to indicate that no clear deduction may be made as to whether the present condition of the magazine would indicate that heat had been applied to an old instrument or age had affected an instrument which had been heated when comparatively new. (4) Is it possible from a comparison of the handwriting of Herrmann at or about the time the message was alleged to have been written in 1917, with his handwriting at or about the time when it was claimed by Germany that he wrote it in 1931, to determine at which age he actually wrote the message? In Exhibit 925, Heinrich had before him the following exemplars of Herr- mann's handwriting: (a) Photostatic copy of application for passport, dated January 12, 1915; (b) Photostatic copy of application for passport, dated June 10, 1915; (c) Photostatic copy of emergency passport application, dated March 4, 1915 ; (d) Photostatic copy of letter dated June 16, 1915, from Fred L. Herrmann to State Department. All in handwriting of Herrmann; (e) Photostatic copy of letter dated June 24, 1916; (f) Original small notebook containing 13 pages of handwriting of Herrmann, written some time between 1915 and 1920; (g) A writing in invisible ink in the January 1932 issue of LOVE STORY</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">MAGAZINE;</h3>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(h)</span><p>Original letter to Mr. H. H. Martin, dated March 13, 1931.</p></div>
<p>Heinrich reports that he has examined all the above exemplars of Herrmann's handwriting and compared them with the writing of the message. This exami- nation was undertaken to determine whether or not there were any character- istics in these writings having a date significance. He further reports as follows (Ex. 925, p. 44) : " The only manner in which the writing of the Herrmann message differs from any of the exemplars is in the matter of speed and size of writing. * * * the passport application dated January 12, 1915, affords an example of relatively slow writing which is strikingly similar to the slow writing of the Herrmann message." Heinrich further reports, therefore, that he is of opinion that the Herrmann message was written by the writer of the Herrmann exemplars. He found one change in the Herrmann writings which has a date significance as follows : " This change appears in the writer's treatment of the letter ' t ', when that letter occurs at the end of a word. In the older examples of the Herrmann writing the final ' t ' is crossed with a short bar, in the standard form. In the later Herrmann writing the final ' t ' is crossed with a swinging stroke which rises from the foot of the stem, passes through it to the left, and then, turning to the right, crosses it again at a suitable height. The resulting form is something like that of an 8." (Id. p. 45.) Heinrich found that the later form was in use by Herrmann as early as 1915, but it was used only occasionally. The exemplars of recent date show a practi- cally 100% use of the later form, i. e., the rapidly written form shaped like an " 8 ". The writing of the period 1915-1916 just prior to the date of Exhibit 904 shows a use of the standard form almost as consistent. The Herrmann message shows the letter " t " used at the end of a word in twenty instances. In every one of these instances the " t " is crossed in the old style, or standard form. As this old style, or standard form, is used 100% in the Herrmann message and is habitually used by the writer in his earlier exemplars, 30</p>
<p>454</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>it has a strong date significance. If Herrmann's present habit of writing the final " t " had become fixed at the time of writing the Herrmann message,. Heinrich is of opinion he could not have avoided using this later style in a writing as long as the Herrmann message. Heinrich is of opinion that the use of the " 8 " or later form in the Herrmann message was not due to the fact that he was writing with invisible ink, because the example of writing in invisible ink in the January. 1932 LOVE STORY MAGAZINE which was developed by Heinrich in Berkeley, California, con- tained five instances of a " t " at the end of a word, and in every word Herrmann made the " t " in the " 8 " or later form. Heinrich concludes his opinion on this point as follows (id. p. 46) : " In my opinion, therefore, the evidence afforded by the handwriting of the message, though not many-sided, and so indicative rather than conclusive, furnishes evidence that fits in, and may be considered in connection with, the physical facts above considered, which establish, beyond any justifiable doubt, in my opinion, that the message was written at the time at which the writer declares that it was written." A careful examination of the reports filed by the German experts fails to disclose any notice of, or answer to, this argument made by Heinrich, and while it is not necessarily conclusive, it has at least persuasive effect that the Herrmann message is an exemplar of Herrmann's writing in a very much earlier form than his present method of writing. From a careful study of the expert evidence offered by Germany attacking the message, and a comparison of the same with the expert evidence offered by the American Agent, the following propositions seem clear: (1) The condition of the pin pricks, which has been subjected to microscopic analysis and reports, indicates that the pin pricks were put in the paper when the magazine was relatively new. (2) The perforations and abrasions by the pen are just as noticeable in the center of the pages as in the margins and do not differ in character, thus indica- ting that the paper had not become embrittled when the message was written. (3) The extent to which the lemon juice was penetrated or struck through the paper proves conclusively that the message was written on the paper when the paper was comparatively new and could not have been written in 1931. (4) A comparison of the handwriting of Herrmann in 1915 and 1916 with his handwriting in 1930 to 1932 strengthens the conclusion already reached that the message was written at a time when the writer had the writing habits of 1915 and 1916, and not when he had the writing habits of 1930 and 1932. The general conclusion, therefore, from the expert evidence is, that the expert evidence sustains the authenticity of the Herrmann message.</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">IV. CONCLUSIONS</h3>
<p>Before reaching definite conclusions on the whole case, it is proper to examine the charges of fraud made by the German Agent. Since the hearing of 1936, the German Agent filed his brief of November 16, 1938, and two reply briefs, one of January 12, 1939, relating to points of law, and one ofjanuary 14, 1939, replying to the American Agent's brief of December 5, 1938. In his brief filed November 16, 1938, as well as in his brief filed January 14, 1939, the German Agent has failed to meet, in many particulars, the charges of fraud which are specifically set out and enumerated in the American Agent's brief of 1936 and repeated in his brief of September 13, 1938, and he has failed to examine or to answer the evidence adduced to sustain those charges.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>455 Some of the subjects which have been neglected by the German Agent are: Marguerre's false testimony; Woehst'sperjuries and Hinsch's perjuries, especial- ly on the charge that Gerdts was unknown to Hilken. No answer has been attempted to the evidence adduced to show that the Lyndhurst testimony was purchased and known to Wozniak's demands for recompense, his affidavits were filed, and that payments to Wozniak did not cease even after the German Agent claims to have broken off all relations with him. No defense has been be false. No reply has been made to the charge that the correspondence between the German Agent and Wozniak showed that, after made of the conduct of the German Agent in filing Wozniak's testimony after he had received demands for recompense which were in the nature of blackmail threats. No defense has been made of the German Agent's approval of payment by Carella, an attorney employed by Germany, of large sums of money to the Lyndhurst witnesses, both before and after their affidavits were filed, nor of his approval of the agreement which Carella made with the Lyndhurst witness that, after the termination of the cases, they should have additional remuneration " to keep C.farella] and his people in line ". Osborn's conduct as an investigator has neither been explained, repudiated nor upheld by the German Agent, nor has his cooperation with Stein in con- nection with the charge of a suppressed report been defended or repudiated. The former German Agent's conduct in misrepresenting to the Commission the amount of fee charged by, and paid to, Osborn has been passed in silence. On the other hand, the German Agent has interspersed in his briefs numerous charges of suppression and fraudulent conduct on the part of the American Agent, his counsel, the claimants, their attorneys, and their witnesses. In coming to the conclusions reached in this case, an attempt has been made to exclude all of the evidence against which the charge of fraud by the German Agent has been directed, and the conclusions have been reached independently of such evidence, not because it was believed that the German Agent's accusations were substantiated, but simply in order that the conclusions reached might not be based upon evidence which had been questioned. In consequence of this position, it has not been necessary to consider whether the Palmer reports were genuine or not, nor has the decision been affected by the Wozniak letters (Ex. 905, 1, 2 and 3) or the charge made in regard thereto. Whether the marriage certificate of Elizabeth Rushnak could have been obtained by the claimants or not has nothing to do with the decision in this case. So, also, the testimony of Larkin has not figured in the conclusions which have been reached. In reaching the conclusion in this case, it has not been necessary to determine whether Wozniak was in Mexico or in Tupper Lake in the summer of 1917, because these questions were collateral to the issues and the decision reached thereon. So, also, this opinion has been reached without considering the information coming from the Austrian archives, alleged to have had their origin in the German archives. Although the German Agent has made charges of a serious character against the American Agent and his counsel, a thorough examination of the record discloses that there is no ground therefor. On the contrary, their entire good faith and earnest efforts to aid the Commission to reach a just decision are attested by a long and tedious record. At an informal meeting of the Commission, of which no minutes were kept, and with no recorder present, the German Agent made a savage attack upon the American Agent's counsel, and indirectly upon the American Agent, charging that a report of the Bureau of Standards adverse to the genuineness of the</p>
<p>456</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>Herrmann message had been suppressed. This charge is repeated and ampli- fied in the German Agent's brief of January 14, 1939. The entire dealings of the American Agent and his counsel with the Bureau of Standards are set out in Exhibit 1006, Annex E, filed December 19, 1938. In his report to the Commission, dated December 16, 1938, E. C. Crittenden, Acting Director of the Bureau of Standards, filed all the papers relating to this subject, except the reports of R. E. Lofton on pin pricks (Ex. 921-1 and Ex. 963), which had been previously filed. In the course of his letter the Acting Director says: " The Commission is advised that no report was requested and none was given by the Bureau in 1931 involving an examination of the Herrmann Message con- tained in the Blue Book Magazine, January 1917 issue, that I am advised was filed June [July] 1, 1931, with the Mixed Claims Commission, United States and Germany, as exhibit 904. Such examination as was made in the Bureau of the document in 1931 did not disclose anything that tended, in the opinion of the members of our staff who examined the document, to cast any doubt on its genuineness." In spite of this assurance, the German Agent has again renewed his charge of a suppressed report and has endeavored again to put the Counsel for the Ameri- can Agent in the position of having consciously suppressed a report unfavorable to the message. An examination of the papers filed with Exhibit 1006, Annex E, will show that the Bureau of Standards did make some experiments with invisible fluid writing on a copy of a Blue Book magazine of January, 1917, furnished by the Counsel for the American Agent (Ex. 977). The results of these experiments were transmitted to the American Agency on July 14, 1931, by George K. Burgess, Director of the Bureau of Standards, in which the Director reported as follows : " You will note from the inclosed report that we were unable to find any means of estimating the age the writing in question. We found that the paper in the magazine involved, another copy of the magazine of the same date, and the magazine dated August, 1931, all have practically the same composition. " We regret that we are unable to be of assistance in this matter." This report, which was purely negative, has no significance, and the failure of the Counsel of the American Agent to recall that such a report had been made and to file the same with the Commission as an Exhibit in this case does not in the least subject him to criticism or to the attack of the German Agent charging a suppressed report. The German Agent, however, has not been content to accept the explanation given by Mr. Martin and the Acting Director of the Bureau of Standards as a frank and full statement as to the relations between the American Agent and his counsel, on the one side, and the Bureau of Standards on the other. He now charges that there must have been a report made in 1932, in addition to the reports made by Lofton on the pin pricks, and that the studious silence of Counsel for the American Agent and his failure to reiterate that no report was made in 1932 except the reports of Lofton is significant that there must have been another report made in 1932 unfavorable to the authenticity of the message. In our view the report which has been made by the Counsel for the American Agent in Exhibit 1006, Annex E, is a frank explanation of what has occurred, and no ground exists for the charge that either he or the Bureau of Standards has withheld from the Commission any report made by it in this case.</p>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>457 The Conclusion on the Question of Fraud Restated By reference to the Summary and Conclusions on the Question of Fraud (supra, this Opinion p. 154), bt&gt; it will be ascertained that the pleadings filed on behalf of Germany were false, and were known to be false, in claiming that Germany had never authorized sabotage in neutral countries nor in the United States during its neutrality, and in claiming that, though men and material for sabotage were sent to the United States in 1916, definite instructions had been given limiting and prohibiting activity until the time when the United States should enter the war. It has been clearly established that Wozniak, at whose bench the Kingsland fire started, and upon whose testimony the Commission relied in its decision at Hamburg, was guilty of perjury and fraud, and in addition, that, before his affidavits were filed, he demanded and received payments therefor. His de- mands, both oral and by letters, for compensation began before his affidavits were filed; and, although he was paid over $2,000, these demands had not ceased when Germany repudiated him as a witness. After his repudiation by Germany, he contradicted all of the important points of his former testimony. The Lyndhurst testimony, upon which the Commission in fact based its decision at Hamburg with regard to the Kingsland fire, was false and purchased, and known to have been false before the affidavits were filed by Germany, and the witnesses producing the testimony were promised additional compensation when the case should be closed. Ahrendt, Woehst and Hinsch, German witnesses produced to disprove the confessions of Herrmann and Hilken, are shown to have been perjurers and guilty of the grossest forms of prevarication. Hinsch, upon whose testimony Germany mainly relied to break down the confessions of Herrmann and Hilken and to destroy the Herrmann message, began his sabotage activities under Rintelen and continued them, under Hilken as paymaster, until he was forced to flee from this country to escape a Presidential warrant of arrest. In order to substantiate Germany's false pleadings Hinsch made many false statements upon which the Commission relied in its opinions. In order to attack the Herrmann message, he was guilty of the basest forms of prevarication, and upon these the Commission relied in its decisions at Hamburg and af Washington in 1932. We have, therefore, concluded that the decision of October 16, 1930, reached at Hamburg, must be set aside, revoked and annulled, and the cases reinstated in the position where they were before that decision was reached. The opinion which was rendered at Washington, December 3, 1932, has already been examined and quoted (supra, p. 156). i1 In that opinion, the Umpire after setting out the decoded form of the message said (Decs, and Ops., p. 1016): « " A glance through this translation will indicate that, without reference to any other evidence, it is conclusive proof to any reasonable man that (a) Herrmann and Hilken knew the Kingsland fire and the Black Tom explosion were the work of German agents and (b) that Hinsch, Hilken, and Herrmann, undoubted agents, were privy thereto, and (in the light of the record before the Commission) (c) that Kristoff and Wozniak were active participants in these events. As the American Agent has well said, I may utterly disregard all the new evidence produced and still, if I deem this message genuine, hold Germany responsible in both of the cases."

<p>In a note appended to his separate opinion, the Honorable Chandler P. Andersen, the American Commissioner, used the following language (Decs, and Ops., p. 1035): kk " The so-called Herrmann secret message, embodied in the Blue Book Maga- zine for January, 1917 (Exhibit No. 904), if accepted as authentic, would conclusi- vely prove the liability of Germany in both the Kingsland and the Black Tom cases." Therefore, in the decision at Washington, the Commission was unanimously of opinion that, if the authenticity of the Herrmann message be accepted, this would conclusively prove the liability of Germany in both the Kingsland and Black Tom cases. The final conclusions in these cases, therefore, may be stated as follows: (1) The decision of October 16, 1930. reached at Hamburg, must be set aside, revoked and annulled; and, the cases reinstated in the position they were before that decision was rendered. (2) Since the authenticity of the Herrmann message has been established, the liability of Germany in both the Black Tom case and in the Kingsland case has now been clearly established by the record, and the cases are in position for awards.</p>

<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-1"><span class="para-num">1.</span><p>Within the meaning and intent of the agreement by which the Commission was constituted and its powers denned, there exists a disagreement between the two national commissioners. As I participated with them in the conferences after submission of the cases, I am cognizant of the disagreement, which makes it my duty to act in the decision of the cases. If more were needed, I have before me the certificate and opinion of the American Commissioner, Ac- cordingly I record my opinion as Umpire.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-2"><span class="para-num">2.</span><p>I concur in the views expressed by the American Commissioner to the effect that the withdrawal of the German Commissioner, after submission by the parties, and after the tribunal, having taken the cases under advisement, pursuant to its rules, was engaged in the task of deciding the issues presented, did not oust the jurisdiction of the Commission. The full discussion of this matter by the American Commissioner renders it unnecessary for me to do more than to express my agreement with his reasoning and his conclusions. I hold that the Com- mission as now constituted has jurisdiction to decide the pending motions.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-3"><span class="para-num">3.</span><p>The decision filed at Washington in 1932 having been set aside, the cases are now before the Commission on the motion of the American Agent to set aside the decision on the merits rendered as the result of the submission at The Hague in 1930 and to grant a rehearing on the whole record, comprising the proofs offered before and after The Hague decision. The grounds of this motion sufficiently appear from prior decisions of the Commission.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-4"><span class="para-num">4.</span><p>As set forth in the American Commissioner's opinion, he and the Umpire agreed in the conclusion that the motion should be granted because the United States had proved its allegation that fraud in the evidence presented by Germany misled the Commission and affected its decision in favor of Germany. The German Commissioner was apprised of this conclusion before he withdrew from kk JVole by the Secietanat. this volume, p. 126.</p></div>
<h2 class="doc-h2">DECISIONS</h2>
<p>459 the deliberations of the Commission. He insisted, nevertheless, that before the motion should be granted, the Commission should examine the proofs tendered by the United States to determine whether the claims had been made good. This was on the ground that, though the Commission had been misled by false and fraudulent testimony, that fact would be immaterial if, as an independent consideration, the United States had in its own cases failed to sustain the burden of proof incumbent upon it. The American Commissioner and the Umpire thereupon agreed to go beyond what they thought the necessary function of the Commission in the circumstances and proceed to canvass with the German Commissioner the cases as made by the United States. During the course of this investigation the German Commissioner withdrew.</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-5"><span class="para-num">5.</span><p>Much evidence has been submitted since the decision of 1932 which cor- roborates the testimony of Herrmann and Hilken and weakens the attacks on their credibility. This is examined, analyzed and compared with the record as it stood when the case was submitted at The Hague, in the opinion of the American Commissioner, and no purpose would be served by restatement of the same matters in this opinion. In my view the statements of Wozniak to Depart- ment of Justice agents and to the Bureau of Naturalization; the testimony of Herrmann, Hilken, Wozniak, Ahrendt, Thorne, and Hilken, Sr., taken in open court, under the statute; and the material drawn from the files of the Eastern Forwarding Company, and the evidence as to the so-called Lyndhurst testimony, is persuasive that the Commission was seriously misled to the conclusion it reached upon the submission at The Hague.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-6"><span class="para-num">6.</span><p>All of the above tends to strengthen the cases of the United States. As is admitted, the Herrmann message, if genuine, establishes Germany's responsi- bility in both cases. In the decision of 1932 the Commission was unable to make an affirmative finding of the authenticity of the message. A large body of evidence has since been introduced addressed to the considerations which caused the Commission to withhold such a finding. This is examined and discussed at length in the opinion of the American Commissioner, and there is no need to add to what he has said. The circumstances of the production of the document to the claimants and the incidents of its transmission and delivery to Hilken have been cleared up. The Quakers story has been completely discredited, and its demolition involves serious implications concerning Germany's defense. The views formerly held respecting the expert evidence must be revised in the light of the evidence of Osborn and the letters and documents exhibiting his activities and attitude. Further argument and extended study of the contents of the message, and of Hinsch's and Siegel's testimony and comparison with the record as it stood prior to The Hague argument, tends to negative the adverse con- clusions heretofore drawn from the references to current and past events and to persons and places contained in the message. I agree with the American Com- missioner that on the evidence now before the Commission the decision must be in favor of the authenticity of the message.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-mcc_award_1939-7"><span class="para-num">7.</span><p>I find that, for the reason alleged by the United States in its petitions for rehearing, — material fraud in the proofs presented by Germany, and for the further reason that on the record as it now stands the claimants' cases are made out, the pending motions should be and they are granted.</p></div>

<p>After the announcement of the foregoing opinion of the American Commis- sioner and the decision of the Commssion, the following action was taken (Minutes of meeting, June 15, 1939, pp. 1717, 1718): " The American Agent then moved that upon the record as it now stands, that awards be entered in accordance with the opinions which have been rendered today. " The Umpire replied that in view of what appeared in the record, and based upon the American Agent's motion, the Commission was prepared to sign awards, to be submitted by the American Agent, if approved by the Commission as to form. He further said that they might be submitted and if approved would be made at a further meeting to be called on notice. " At this point the Joint Secretaries were directed to spread the following Order upon the Minutes of the Commission : " 1. The decision of October 16, 1930, reached at Hamburg be, and the same is hereby, set aside, revoked and annulled. " 2. The Commission finds, on the record as it now stands, that the liability of Germany in both the Black Tom and Kingsland cases has been established. " 3. It appearing from the communications, each dated June 10, 1939, one from the German Agent to the Commission, and the other from the German Embassy to the Secretary of State, that Germany does not intend to exercise her right to take further part in the proceedings of the Commission, and that on the findings made and opinions handed down this day by the Commission, and from what appears in the record, awards should now be rendered to the United States on behalf of claimants ; the American Agent is directed to prepare and submit to the Commission for its approval awards in each of the pending sabotage claims. These awards will be considered at a further meeting of the Commission to be called on notice, and appropriate action thereon will then be taken.

<p>[German Chargé d'Affaires ad Interim to the Secretary of State] [Translation] German Embassy Washington, D. C. October 3, 1939 Mr. Secretary of State: By direction of my Government I have the honor to make the following detailed statements to Your Excellency, supplementing my note of July 11, 1939 l: In the note of July 11. the German Government, through me, had protested to Your Excellency against certain acts in the proceedings before the German-American Mixed Commission on the so-called Black Tom and Kingsland cases and had called the attention of Your Excellency to the fact that measures for remedying [these matters] are urgently [p. 1728] required. By direction of My Government I had already protested most emphatically in this note against the decision of the American Umpire to grant awards in favor of the American and Canadian claimants, and also against all steps already taken and still to be taken by the American Agent for obtaining awards. At the same time I had requested Your Excellency to bring this protest and the declaration of my Government, that any "awards" of the rump Commission are void, to the knowledge of the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. Lastly I had announced in this note that I would take occasion in a further note to return to details of the above-mentioned violations of the rules of procedure and all other serious irregularities which have occurred since March 1 in the procedure of the Commission. As Your Excellency advised me by the note of July 20, a copy of my note of July 11 was sent to the Treasury Department of the United States. The present note is intended to serve the purpose announced and will discuss in detail the violations of the rules of procedure in the proceedings continued before the rump Commission. The German Government regrets all the more to have to make protests against this procedure, because the German-American Mixed Commission could look back upon a model success in working, which had been made possible by confidential and friendly collaboration of the members of the Commission and the two National Agents. It is characteristic of the spirit in which the so-called Black Tom and Kingsland cases in particular were treated by the German Government that the claims of the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company arising out of the explosion at the Black Tom Terminal, which Company was chiefly concerned, were admitted into the proceedings before the German-American Mixed Commission only because [p. 1729] of voluntary admission by the German Government, after delay in submission. The German Government could have decisively excluded any discussion of these claims by referring to their delayed submission and the incompetence of the Commission arising therefrom. However, it did not pursue this course, but opened to the American Government and the American parties concerned the possibility of submitting the claims to the Com- mission for investigation and decision, by agreeing to the admission of these claims into the proceedings of the Commission, despite the delay in application, which would not have been possible without its assent. The outcome was the decision of October 16, 1930, by which the Commission unanimously denied the claims arising out of the explosion at the Black Tom Terminal and also the claims arising out of the fire at the Kingsland factory. According to the agreement between the German Government and the United States Government of August 10, 1922, this decision was to be accepted by both Governments as final and binding. Despite this provision, however, the American 1 Not part of Minutes of Commission.</p>

<p>501 Agent submitted three applications in succession for reopening [of the cases], the first two of which were rejected by decisions of the Commission of March 30, 1931, and December 3, 1932. The third application for reopening, which was submitted on May 4, 1933, formed the subject of the last proceedings. In these proceedings there began the serious irregularities under discussion, which led to the withdrawal of the German Commissioner on March 1, 1939, and which finally reached their culmination in those measures against which the German Government found itself compelled to protest most emphatically.</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-letter_thomsen-1"><span class="para-num">1.</span><p>The German Government sees the first violation of the basic agreements of the two Governments and the Regulations on Procedure of the Commission in the fact that early in June 1939 the American Commissioner on his own motion drew up and published an order by which a "session of the Commission" was called for June 15. As I have already [p. 1730] stated in my note of June 10 addressed to Your Excellency immediately after this measure became known, there was no legal basis whatever for such a unilateral manner of action of the American Commissioner and for the holding of a "session of the Commission". Despite these protests, the American Umpire and the American Commissioner, to whose knowledge my note had been brought, held the "session" that was called and at this meeting issued a "judgment" and also a decision on questions of the greatest importance. At the conclusion of this "session", the American Umpire announced that the "Com- mission" would hold a further "session" for the issuance of "awards", notices of which would be sent out. As previously in my notes of June 10 and July 11, 1939, I again consider myself compelled now to call attention to the fact that during the vacancy in the position of the German Commissioner the Commission was incompetent to make a decision and therefore could not assemble for meetings either. The Commission is a mixed Commission; consequently decisions as to the holding of sessions and all other decisions can be made only by collaboration of the two National Commissioners. This self-evident principle has, in addition, been confirmed explicitly in the Agree- ment of August 10, 1922, between the German Government and the United States Government, Article III of which reads as follows: " They (the National Commissioners) may fix the time and place of their sub- sequent meetings according to convenience." According to this the American Commissioner and the American Umpire have no power and no right to call meetings of the Commission without the collaboration of the German Commissioner or to hold sessions at which measures concerning Germany are discussed, ordered or promulgated. The Agreement of August 10, 1922 is the charter established for the Commission by the two governments, which is unalterable for the Commission. Under it, the Commission is composed of the two [p. 1731] National Commissioners, and the Agreement of August 10, 1922 gives them the right to adjust the procedure and determine its course. In order that no doubt may arise as to the view of the German Government, it is emphasized that in none of its communications has it taken the stand that by the withdrawal of the German Commissioner the Commission has become "functus officio" and has thereby lost its competence. The withdrawal of the German Commissioner has, in the opinion of the German Government, not produced such an effect; the matters covered by the Agreement of August 10, 1922, which were brought before the Commission in the proper way, within the framework of the agreements of the two Governments, belong, just as before, under its competence. The sole conclusive question here is whether during the vacancy in the position of the German Commissioner the American Commissioner, whether alone or jointly with the American Umpire, can exercise functions which the governmental agree- ment has entrusted to the two National Commissioners for joint exercise. Under 33</p></div>

<p>the Agreement of August 10, 1922, no such authority of the American Commissioner exists. By direction of my Government I therefore protest most emphatically against the holding of the further "session of the Commission" announced by the Umpire.</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-letter_thomsen-2"><span class="para-num">2.</span><p>No less illegal than the calling and holding of the "session" of June 15, 1939, was the manner of action of the American Commissioner in the first matter which he treated at this meeting with the American Umpire. He made public a summary of the letters which he himself and the American Umpire had exchanged early in March 1939 with the German Commissioner, who has withdrawn. On the basis of an order issued by him the text of these letters, copies of which he made available, was reproduced in the report of the session. But not only was the text of the letters included in the records of the [p. 1732] Commission and in the report of the session, but the American Commissioner embodied it also in subsequent written statements in which he attempted to prove the existence of a disagreement between himself and the German Commissioner. The correspondence thus employed by the American Commissioner concluded with a letter of March 3 addressed by him to the German Commissioner, in which he made the assertion that the stage of disagreement had already been reached in the discussions of the Commission. This enumeration and employment of the correspondence by the American Commissioner was bound to create the impression and doubtless was intended to do so, that the letters were reproduced in full and that the German Commissioner had accepted, by maintaining silence, the above mentioned assertion of the American Commissioner. The picture of the written exchange of opinions between the two National Commissioners which the American Commissioner in this way caused to appear in the records and in his subsequent written statements was, however, incorrect. Immediately after the German Commissioner, [now] withdrawn, had received the letter of March 3 from the American Commissioner, he most decidedly contradicted the assertion that he had dissented in the deliberations. In a letter to the American Commissioner written on that same day, a copy of which I sent to Your Excellency on July 10, he set forth clearly and in detail those facts and opinions which showed the incorrectness of the stand of the American Commissioner. Of special significance on this point are the following statements in the reply of the German Commissioner to the American Commissioner, of March 3 : " I surely reserved any decision of mine with respect to the question as to whether the cases should be reopened or not. This was a necessary consequence of the point of view held by all three [p. 1733] of us, viz. that there could be no reopening, if the new decision on the old and new evidence taken together should be identical in tenor with the Hamburg Decision. " . . . I reserved also my decision with respect to the question as to whether the Hamburg Decision had been reached upon false and fraudulent evidence. Certainly I put before you the doubts which might militate against such an assump- tion. But from reaching a decision about this point which might be considered as a definite agreement or disagreement I naturally refrained . . . " I never should have formally disagreed on anything in this case without giving a fully substantiated written opinion. " How far we were from any agreement or disagreement may be best evidenced by the fact that none of us had even touched upon the subject of the nationality of the Canadian Car Agency, also you yourself will hardly entertain any doubt that this question of jurisdiction or may be of the substance of the case would be a part and topic of any decision." It does not need to be emphasized that this letter was of decisive significance in judging of the question whether a disagreement between the national Commissioners existed which would have justified the Umpire in taking up the questions brought before the Commission. The failure to place this letter of the German Commissioner</p></div>
<h3 class="doc-h3">APPENDICES</h3>
<p>503 in the records of proceedings and the written statements of the American Com- missioner which the American Umpire accepted as his own, for collaboration in the present cases, is an action which in itself alone stamps the proceedings conducted since March 1 as irregular. Failure to make known the position of the German Commissioner in opposition to the unilateral declaration of the American Com- missioner regarding the alleged disagreement deprives the subsequent acts of the American Umpire of any legal basis and makes them void.</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-letter_thomsen-3"><span class="para-num">3.</span><p>The following acts contrary to the rules of procedure were connected with the incomplete submission of the correspondence discussed in the foregoing paragraph : After the American Commissioner had presented a document designated as a "Certificate of Disagreement" and a vote amounting to about 500 pages, signed by him, the American Umpire read aloud a statement [p. 1734] designated as a "decision", in which he approved the American proposal of May 4, 1933, for reopening. At the same time the American Umpire made the vote of the American Commissioner, comprising 500 pages, a constituent part of his "decision" by citing it. I am instructed to call attention most emphatically to the fact that the cases in question were not at a stage in which the American Umpire had authority to make a decision. His functions, as well as the conditions under which he is authorized and called upon to act, are exactly circumscribed and delimited in the Agreement of August 10, 1922, as well as in the Rules for Procedure of the Commission, established by joint agreement. Article II of the Agreement provides: " The two Governments shall by agreement select an Umpire to decide upon any cases concerning which the Commissioners may disagree or upon any points of difference that may arise in the course of their proceedings." In the Rules of Procedure the following is prescribed: " VIII. (a) The two national commissioners will certify in writing to the Umpire for decision (1) any case or cases concerning which the Commissioners may disagree or (2) any point or points of difference that may arise in the course of their proceedings, accompanied or supplemented by any statement in writing which either of them may desire to make of his opinion with respect to the decision of the case or cases or point or points of difference certified." It is thus made clear in a form excluding any doubt that the Umpire may move to a decision only if two prerequisites are fulfilled, viz. :</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-letter_thomsen-1"><span class="para-num">1.</span><p>A formal disagreement of the two National Commissioners on the controversial question submitted to them for opinion or decision must exist.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-letter_thomsen-2"><span class="para-num">2.</span><p>Both National Commissioners must have certified this disagreement in written form. Neither of these two conditions existed in the present case. [p. 1735] [Comment] on 1. A disagreement of the National Commissioners in the sense of the provisions of the Agreement of August 10, 1922 did not exist either with respect to substance or form. The status of the deliberations at the time of the withdrawal of the German Commissioner is evidenced by a letter which the American Com- missioner addressed to Your Excellency on March 3, 1939, and in which he made the following statement: " . . . We thereupon proceeded to examine the whole record to determine from that record whether the American case had been proven. It was while the Com- mission was engaged in examining this question that Dr. Huecking's action in regard to his retirement was taken." In connection with the statements which Dr. Huecking makes in his letter of March 3, withheld by the American Commissioner, the statement of the American</p></div>
<p>504</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>Commissioner shows plainly that the deliberations of the Commission had not yet led to a disagreement. Hence there was absolutely no factual basis for the assertion made in the "decision" of the Umpire: "Within the meaning and intent of this agreement.. . there exists a disagreement between the two National Commissioners." [Comment] on 2. There was never submitted to the American Umpire a written certificate of disagreement prepared by the two National Commissioners. He had before him merely a document prepared and signed by the American Commissioner by himself, to which there was annexed a so-called vote of the American Com- missioner. Of course, such a document is not a certificate in the sense of the Rules of Procedure cited above.</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-letter_thomsen-4"><span class="para-num">4.</span><p>The content of the "decision" of the American Umpire and the American Commissioner gives reason for the most serious representations. It provides in a striking way a confirmation of the events which led the German Commissioner to withdraw. The German Commissioner made use of the right of withdrawal which is open to the Members of international commissions at any time, and moreover is also expressly provided in Article II of the Agreement [p. 1736] of August 10, 1922, when during the course of the deliberations it became more and more evident to him that the American Umpire was most strongly biased in favor of the American private parties concerned and against Germany. Two phases of the deliberations in which this prejudiced view was shown with special clearness were characterized as follows by the German Commissioner in his letLer to the American Umpire, of March 1, 1939: " . . . In respect to the latest of our claims you introduced as your main point a point which was not made by the claimants at all and which, as far as I am aware, never was argued . . . I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that in my opinion it is not compatible with the position of an umpire and it shows a bias if the Umpire makes points and bases his decisions on them which are not advanced by the party favored by them. The Umpire actually assumes by such a procedure the attitude of a legal adviser for the favored party and does so under circumstances under which the other side can no longer expect equal justice. " . . . It has become clear to me during these days that any argument advanced by the claimants at once attracts your attention and evokes the idea, How could it be collaborated? And any argument advanced in favor of the defendants at once evokes in you the idea, How can it be refuted? " The German Commissioner supplemented this remark with the depiction of the behavior of the American Umpire during the discussion of certain concrete portions of the matter in the case and concluded his letter with the statement: " The result to which I have come is that it is impossible for me to cooperate in a procedure which no longer offers to both parties equally the usual guarantee of a decision arrived at in a really judicial way." This statement carries all the more weight as the American Umpire could find only the following answer to the letter of the German Commissioner of March 1, which, as shown, did not contain any accusations kept on a general plane, but described in detail concrete occurrences in the deliberations: [p. 1737] " I do not propose to enter into any controversy with respect to the statements contained in your letter other than to say that they are unjustified and, in my opinion, present a wholly false picture of our deliberations." The "decision" of the American Umpire and the American Commissioner of June 15 affords clear proof for the statements of the German Commissioner. Cha- racteristic of this is in itself the fact that the American Umpire did not discuss the facts in the case exhaustively in his own remarks, as he had done in his earlier decisions, but himself wrote a "decision" containing only a few paragraphs, but</p></div>
<h3 class="doc-h3">APPENDICES</h3>
<p>505 for the rest accepted the vote of the American Commissioner and made it the substance of his decision. Even a hasty examination of the "decision" thus made up discloses the character of a document in which the German Government is viewed and treated as an opponent in litigation. This attitude is characterized with special clearness by the appearance in a considerable number of places of expressions such as "We have proven" and "We have shown", which do not indicate the deliberations of a judge but are entirely natural for an advocate who sees it as his duty to prove his case against his opponent. In addition it must also be brought out that in astonishingly numerous places the evidence arguing in favor of Germany is represented as unessential or is made light of, while simple statements made by the American Agent against Germany are not only accepted without reserve, but their significance is even emphasized. Further, innumerable are the places at which statements of witnesses of the American Government are sustained in the "decision" without criticism as entirely conclusive and true, while German counter-proofs and German assertions against material of this sort are treated as nonexistent. In this connection the treatment of the statement of an expert witness of the complainants, who designated the disputed "Herrmann report" as a genuine document, deserves special mention. On the German [p. 173B] side reference had been made to material contained in the record, which plainly refuted the conclusions of this expert. This German declaration was not only left unmentioned by the rump Commission in its "decision", but it cited instead, in order to show the witness to be dependable and qualified, alleged pieces of evidence, which had not been mentioned in the case at all, and therefore did not belong to the material in the case, and hence must have been brought to the knowledge of the American Umpire and the American Commissioner subsequently and outside the proceedings. A further evidently wrong conclusion of the Umpire refers to the thesis upon which the "decision" of the rump Commission is founded, viz. that the Black Tom case and the Kingsland case arc proven if the so-called "Herrmann report" is genuine. On this point the American Umpire merely states in the "decision" that this con- sequence is admitted. The German Agent, by whom alone such an admission could be made, has never made such a statement. On the contrary, when the "Herrmann report" was discussed before the Commission for the first time, it was explicitly declared by the German Agent that the "report" would not prove the allegation of the complainants even if it were genuine, which was not the case. In the written statement submitted by the German Agent in preparation for the last verbal discussion, it was also specially brought out that every assertion of the American Agent is opposed by Germany unless its correctness is explicitly admitted. The German Government is further compelled to point out with all emphasis that the American Umpire has shown a complete reversal of his opinion in the judgment on the "Herrmann report", considered by him so important, in so far as its intrinsic value as evidence is concerned. When the American Umpire investigated the [p. 1739] question of the genuineness of the "Herrmann report" in 1932 and decided on it, he designated the contradictory statements of the witnesses and experts of the two parties as irlconclusive. In contrast to this, he placed decisive weight on the intrinsic value of the document itself as evidence. The result of his exhaustive investigation and judgment of this intrinsic value as evidence, the naming of persons and places and the depiction of current and past events in the report, was summa- rized as follows by the American umpire in the decision of December 3, 1932: " But enough has been said to show in how extraordinary a manner this docu- ment dovetails with all the important and disputed points of claimant's case and how pat all these references are, not to the request for funds but to the claimants' points of proof—this aside from the absurdity of sending this unnecessary infor- mation into an enemy country to a suspected spy then under surveillance."</p>
<p>506</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>After the Umpire had considered two further suspicious but less important factors, he closed his judgment on the "Herrmann report" with the statement: " . . The silent but persuasive intrinsic evidence makes it impossible to reach a con- clusion in favor of the claimants and against Germany." These statements of the Umpire, independent of any biased allegations and of external evidence, were bound also to remain unalterable for the whole future, just as the content of the document upon which they were based remained unalterable. The difficulty arising out of this with respect to the overthrowing of his own decision was pushed aside by the American Umpire with the simple statement that further study had converted him to the opinion that the intrinsic evidence confirmed the genuineness of the "Herrmann report". What he had called "absurd" in December 1932 was now illuminating; what he had then designated as impossible, incredible and improbable now became convincing, credible and explicable. Without going into detail as to the points on which his earlier decision on the intrinsic evidence of the "Herrmann report", the reasons for which [p. 1740] were given in such conclusive form, had now proved to be faulty, he states in a few words that the renewed argument and a further exhaustive study of the content of the report (which, according to the explicit statement in his 1932 decision, he had already investigated and evaluated most thoroughly at that time) as well as further study of the statements of two witnesses and of the records as they existed at the time of the Hague pleadings, (again material which the Umpire had investigated most thoroughly prior to the decision of December 3, 1932) had led to this reversal of his opinion. These facts speak more strongly than any criticism can do.</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-letter_thomsen-5"><span class="para-num">5.</span><p>How little disposed the American Umpire was to concern himself with the German evidence and how he placed himself above recognized principles of inter- national law and also above the firmly grounded practice of the Commission with respect to decisions, is shown by the treatment of the case of the Agency of Canadian Car and Foundry Company, which was chiefly concerned in the Kingsland case. It was absolutely clear to the Commission that all of the shares of stock of this concern, which had been inactive for many years, belonged to a Canadian cor- poration domiciled in Montreal, and that consequently the claims of this com- plainant were made exclusively for the benefit of Canadian interests. According to practice supported by several decisions of the Commission, the claims of the Agency of Canadian Car and Foundry Company did not come within its jurisdiction at all. Although the Commission is to view this view in and of itself (sua sponte), the German Agent had also submitted a formal proposal in which he asked that the application for reopening of the case submitted for the benefit of the Canadian interests be rejected a limine in view of their lack of American nationality. A few days before the [p. 1741] beginning of the oral final arguments, the German Agent submitted also a printed statement giving the reasons in detail for this stand. Lastly, the German Commissioner, in his letter of March 3, 1939, withheld by the American Commissioner, pointed out the fact that the question of nationality of the complainant Canadian company belonged among those points which the Com- mission would have to investigate before the promulgation of a decision. It has become known to the German Government that American companies which are holders of older awards have requested the United States Government to refuse its protection to the Canadian claims and that they were informed that the question of handling the claims of the Agency of Canadian Car and Foundry Company would have to be decided by the Commission. The American Umpire and the American Commissioner, however, did not express themselves at all on this question, which is decisive with regard to claims to</p></div>
<h3 class="doc-h3">APPENDICES</h3>
<p>507 several million dollars, and they did not even find it necessary to mention the existence of the opposition raised by the German Government. The German Government finds itself compelled to enter a most emphatic protest against this also. The approval of claims of Canadian interested parties in a procedure which the German Government and the United States Government have established for the settlement of claims of American citizens is null and void.</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-letter_thomsen-6"><span class="para-num">6.</span><p>In the last arguments before the Commission, the procedure was limited strictly to the preliminary question of the alleged misleading of the Commission, as had been maintained by the American Agent. Hence the German Agent refrained at this stage of the proceedings from taking any stand on that point and refrained from the submission of counter evidence on all points which in his opinion were irrelevant to the preliminary question of "misleading", and without regard to the question of whether they would be of essential importance in case of a possible reopening of the proceedings on the main question, that is on the responsibility of Germany. He was able to follow this course with [p. 1742] all the less hesitation, as it corresponded to the principles which the Umpire had established in a decision of November 9, 1934. The German Agent also explicitly invoked these conside- rations, determining his behavior, in explaining his action in the case. If the Commission, in opposition to the opinion of the German Agent, considered as essential a point which he held to be unessential and did not discuss in his written statements or his arguments, it should have called his attention to that fact and should have called on him for a statement with respect thereto. This duty arising out of general rules of procedure was explicitly laid down in the Regulations on Procedure, which the Commission established for the proceedings in the Black Tom and Kingsland cases in its order of March 29, 1929, and which, in view of the tens of thousands of pages of material in the cases, were intended to prevent the possibility of conclusions being drawn, to the disadvantage of one party, from failure to discuss single phases of this enormous amount of evidence. The essential provisions of the Order of the Commission of March 29, 1929 (Rule III) reads as follows: " If any member of the Commission considers a point not orally argued one which should be taken into account in the Commission's decision, counsel's attention will be called thereto during the progress of the argument or subsequent thereto, and counsel for both parties will be given an opportunity to discuss same on the oral argument or to file written or printed briefs within a time to be fixed by the Commission covering such particular point or points." Not only have the American Umpire and the American Commissioner disregarded this binding rule of procedure, but they have also made the statement at various places in their " decision " that the German Agent had not expressed himself regard- ding assertions of the American Agent. Important conclusions are drawn in the "decision", to the disadvantage of Germany, from this alleged silence, [p. 1743]</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-letter_thomsen-7"><span class="para-num">7.</span><p>The violations of procedure stated in the foregoing reached their culmination in the occurrences following the reading aloud of the "decision", to illustrate which I should like to make the following preliminary remarks on the state of the pro- ceedings at that time: As I have already brought out once, the proceedings were strictly limited to the preliminary question of whether the Commission should revoke the unanimous decision of October 16, 1930, rejecting the complaints in full, and should grant reopening of the proceedings. The material question of the justification of the claims, which is entirely separate from the preliminary question of a possible reopening, had been postponed and could be decided, if at all, only after carrying out of the procedure after reopening. This plain method of procedure, established by the Commission itself, thus presupposed a decision on the proposal for reopening the proceedings. Not until after a possible pronouncement of a favorable decision</p></div>

<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>could and should the main question be entered upon in the proceedings, and not until after the conclusion of these proceedings could the question of the responsibility of Germany have been submitted to the two National Commissioners for decision and, in case of a possible disagreement of the Commissioners, to the Umpire for the granting of an award. Any proceedings that might have become necessary respecting the amount of the damage allegedly caused, the method of proving this and the proof of any financial claims of the complainants arising therefrom would have been reserved for a still further stage in the proceedings. In the correspondence exchanged in the years 1927 and 1928 the fully empowered representatives of both Governments had agreed that this last set of questions should be taken up only in case the Commission should decide that Germany was responsible in one of the two cases or both of them, and not until then. As a matter of course, Germany and the United States [p. 1744] would have the right to submit evidence and written state- ments in the proceedings, if any, regarding the alleged responsibility of Germany and in any further proceedings as to the amount of the claims, and also to demand oral arguments thereon if necessary. In the expectation that the American Agent and also the Commission would observe this agreement faithfully, the German Agent had not taken any stand with respect to the American evidence on the amount of damage and had not introduced opposing evidence of any kind. The Commission itself has made plain this legal situation in unmistakable form in two decisions which it issued in order to establish directions for the two National Agents regarding the scope and the form of the action taken by them in the written as well as the oral proceedings. When in 1935 the American Agent adopted the surprising view that the next decision of the Commission ought to cover both the preliminary question of reopening and also the question of the responsibility of Germany, the Umpire stated in a decision of July 29, 1935; " . . . The first step is the determination whether the claimants' assertions as to fraud, et cetera, are made out . . . The relevancy and weight of evidence upon the comparatively narrow issue made by the petition and answer will be one thing; the relevancy and weight of evidence upon the merits if a rehearing be granted will be quite an different thing . . . Germany insists that the preliminary question be determined separately. I am of the opinion that is her right. The next hearing, therefore, will be upon the question of reopening vel non and not upon the merits." A second time the Commission confirmed this legal status in the unanimous decision of June 3, 1936, in which it declared: " . . . Before the Hague Decision may be set aside the Commission must act upon the claimants' petition for rehearing. Whether upon the showing made, the Commission should grant a rehearing, unless Germany shall agree to a different course, must, under the Commission's Decision of July 29, 1935, be determined by a hearing separate from and distinct from any argument on the merits. Both parties are entitled to file evidence (and to exchange briefs) as are in the proceedings in which a ruling for reopening is sought as in the subsequent proceedings dealing with the merits, should such a ruling be granted.1' [p. 1745] It could not in fact be made clearer that on the basis of the oral arguments then in prospect, which took place in January 1939, a decision could and would not be issued on any other question than the justification or non-justification of the Ameri- can Agent's motion for reopening. In spite of this unambiguous legal situation, the American Agent made the plea at the " session " of the rump Commission that awards be granted in favor of the private interests concerned. As this demand involved the question of the respon- sibility of Germany and the question of the amount of the damages allegedly arising, the Commission (assuming that it was capable at all of making a decision) would certainly have had to reject the application of the American Agent, in accordance with its decisions cited above, binding upon itself and the Agents of the two Govern-</p>

<p>509 ments. However, the American Umpire took the absolutely unjustifiable step of approving the petition forthwith, by declaring: " In view of what appears in the record, and based upon the American Agent's motion, the Commission is prepared to sign awards, to be submitted by the Amer- ican Agent, if approved by the Commission as to form. Those may be submitted, and if approved will be made at a further meeting to be called on notice." As I have already stated in my note of July 11, 1939, this method of procedure is an event without parallel in the history of international commissions and courts. Without hesitating even for a moment (not a single minute had elapsed since the making of the motion), the American Umpire decided, leaving out of consideration entirely the guarantees given to Germany by himself and the Commission, on extremely important questions, which had never been the subject of proceedings and had never been submitted to the Commission for decision by the two National Agents. In this connection it must be taken into consideration that the Umpire himself in a decision of Decem- ber 15, 1933 on the cases in question, had declared that in view of the completion [p. 1746] of the arguments of the National Agents the Commission by no means had the freedom of action of ordinary courts and could not decide a disputed case unless both Agents had given their agreement thereto by written statements. He said at that time: " The Commission has from its inception been sensible of its lack of power to compel the closing of the record and the final submission of any case . . . It has never, as I am advised, entered an order for the final closing of the record in any case without consent or over objection. / do not think it has power to do so." Plain language is also used in the order of the American Umpire that the American Agent should submit the awards " for signing by the Commission ". The Agreement of August 10, 1922, does not present the slightest ground for the authority to transfer unilaterally to the Agent of one party such important functions, which are ex- clusively the business of the two National Commissioners. As the German Agent, trusting, in the Agreement made with the American Agent in the years 1927 and 1928, had failed entirely to take any stand with regard to the amount of the alleged damages or to submit counter-proof, the action of the American Umpire means that the measurement of the amount of damage and of the claims is based entirely upon the allegations in the case and the evidence which the lawyers of the American and Canadian private parties have assembled, who are most keenly concerned in the fixing of the highest possible amounts of damage. This method of action of the American Umpire, contrary to the rules and in contradiction to any idea of a judicial decision, reaches its culmination in his announcement that the " Commission " will sign the awards, if they have been approved by the " Commission " as to form. (" The Commission is prepared to sign awards to be submitted by the American Agent, if approved by the Commission as to form.") The statement made by the American Umpire shows clearly that investigation of the sums of damages established unilaterally by the complaining party and without possibility of opposition, would refer only to [p. 1747] certain requirements as to outer form, but not to the material establishment of the amount of damages—and this in a litigation between two sovereign Governments, in which the uninvestigated claims amount to approximately $40,000,000 ! The statement of reasons for the decision of the American Umpire, that he was acting "in view of what appears in the record" and was taking as a basis "the motion of the American Agent" ("In view of what appears in the record and based upon the American Agent's motion"), is adapted only to emphasize the arbitrary character of his action. Not one single fact is contained in the record which could form a basis for his decision above. As far as the motion of the American Agent that is referred to is concerned, the latter was restricted to the following unsub- stantiated assertion:</p>
<p>510</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">UNITED STATES/GERMANY</h3>
<p>" . . . In view of the attitude of Germany, as expressed in the communications between the German Commissioner and the Umpire and the American Commissioner, and the communication between the German Embassy and the Secretary of State of the United States, it is apparent that Germany does not intend to take any further part in the proceedings before this Commission, and seeks to avoid a final conclusion, and frustrate the work of the Commission." It is evident from this that the American Umpire based decisions of the very greatest importance not upon facts according to the record but contented himself with one-sided partisan assertions which represented an arbitrary evaluation and interpretation by the American Agent of my note of June 10, 1939, addressed to Your Excellency and the two letters of the German Commissioner of March 1st. It does not need to be explained that such evaluations and interpretations cannot serve as the basis for an important motion in a case or in fact for a decision, entirely aside from the fact that the communications of the withdrawing German Com- missioner were not submitted in full at the " session " of the rump Commission, the specially [p. 1748] significant letter of March 3, 1939, being omitted, and were entered in the record of the session in that form. The interpretation which the American Agent gave to the statements in my note to Your Excellency of June 10, 1939, and to the written remarks of the German Commissioner was in every respect baseless and arbitrary; the documents do not contain a single word that might justify his assertions. The American Umpire has and had no authority at all to concern himself with the motion to grant awards. As I have had occasion to remark repeatedly, the statute of the Commission establishes the principle that the discussion and in- vestigation of all matters brought before it is in the first place exclusively the business of the two National Commissioners. They compose the Commission. The Umpire can act only under certain fully defined conditions, and his duty is strictly limited " to deciding on all cases in which the Commissioners might be of differing opinions." The motion of the American Agent asking for the issuance of awards was not discussed by both Commissioners at any stage of the procedure before the Commis- sion nor was it the subject of an exchange of opinions between the Commissioners. Therefore there is not the remotest possibility of speaking of the occurrence of a disagreement of the National Commissioners, which is an indispensable prerequisite for the Umpire to concern himself with the matter and make a decision. The decision made by the American Umpire on this question is a function which he usurped in violation of the statute of the Commission. To sum up, it appears therefore that the "decision" of the American Umpire, which contemplates the issuance of awards, was issued in disregard and violation of essential provisions of the statute of the Commission, essential agreements be- tween the German Government and the United States Government, essential rules of procedure and binding decisions of the full Commission, the observance of which would have been the absolute duty of the American Umpire. (The Agreement between the two governments of August 10, 1922; the Rules of Procedure [p. 1749] established jointly; the Decisions of the Commission of July 29, 1935 and July 3, 1936, as well as the agreement of the Agents of the two Governments of the years 1927 and 1928 on the treatment of the question of the amount of alleged damages.) Accordingly the acts and orders of the American Umpire and the American Commissioner since March 1, 1939, among them the reopening of the proceedings in the Black Tom and Kingsland cases, the " decision " of the Umpire and the American Commissioner on the responsibility of Germany in both cases, and the arbitrary granting of awards by the American Umpire, are null and void. Any awards which the American Umpire and the American Commissioner might issue on the basis of these measures are likewise null and void. They can never form the basis for a financial obligation of Germany. A document which has been drawn up</p>

<p>511 without any collaboration of the German Commissioner can, besides, never be considered or accepted as an award of the "Mixed Commission". By direction of my Government I therefore raise once more the most emphatic representations against all violations of the rules of procedure and illegal acts of the American Umpire disclosed in this note. I am directed to protest against all further measures planned by the American Umpire, the American Commissioner and the American Agent, which are aimed at securing awards in the Black Tom and Kings- land cases. I request Your Excellency to advise the Treasury Department of the United States, upon which the payment of awards is incumbent, of the contents of this note, and I should be grateful if one copy of this note were also sent to the American Umpire and one to the American Commissioner. By direction of my Government, I should like to express the hope that the United States Government does not approve of the violations of procedure discussed in this note and that it will find some way of quashing them, in order to restore, in colla- boration with [p. 1750] the German Government, the basis existing before the beginning of these violations of procedure, upon which the proceedings can be brought to a conclusion in an orderly way. Accept, Mr. Secretary of State, the renewed assurance of my most distinguished consideration.</p>

<p>His Excellency Mr. Cordell HULL, Secretary of State of the United States, Washington, D. C. [Emphasis in original.] [The Secretary of State to the German Charge1 d'Affaires ad interim] [p. 1751] October 18, 1939 Sir: I acknowledge the receipt of your note of October 3, 1939 with reference to proceedings of the Mixed Claims Commission, United States and Germany, in relation to the so-called Black Tom and Kingsland cases pending before that tribunal. In conformity with your request, copies of a translation of your note under acknowledgment are being forwarded to the Secretary of the Treasury, the Umpire, and the Commissioner appointed by the United States. I must refrain from engaging in a discussion of the various complaints and protests set out in your communication and content myself by stating that since the Depart- ment is without jurisdiction over the Commission I consider that it would be highly inappropriate for it to intervene directly or indirectly in the work of the Commission or to endeavor, in the slightest manner, to determine the course of its proceedings. I have entire confidence in the ability and integrity of the Umpire and the Commissioner appointed by the United States despite your severe and, I believe, entirely unwarranted criticisms, and I am constrained to invite your attention to the fact that the remarkable action of the Commissioner appointed by Germany was apparently designed to frustrate or postpone indefinitely the work of the Commission at a time when, after years of labor on the particular cases involved, it was expected that its functions would be brought to a conclusion. Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my high consideration.</p>

<p>C42 Pt. 1 modified (24.3.2022) by Commercial Rent (Coronavirus) Act 2022 (c. 12), s. 31(4), Sch. 1 paras. 1, 2 (with s. 30, Sch. 1 para. 3) Introductory 1 General principles. The provisions of this Part are founded on the following principles, and shall be construed accordingly— (a) the object of arbitration is to obtain the fair resolution of disputes by an impartial tribunal without unnecessary delay or expense; (b) the parties should be free to agree how their disputes are resolved, subject only to such safeguards as are necessary in the public interest; (c) in matters governed by this Part the court should not intervene except as provided by this Part. 2 Scope of application of provisions. (1) The provisions of this Part apply where the seat of the arbitration is in England and Wales or Northern Ireland. (2) The following sections apply even if the seat of the arbitration is outside England and Wales or Northern Ireland or no seat has been designated or determined— [F1(za) section 6A (law applicable to arbitration agreement),] (a) sections 9 to 11 (stay of legal proceedings, &amp;c.), and (b) section 66 (enforcement of arbitral awards). (3) The powers conferred by the following sections apply even if the seat of the arbitration is outside England and Wales or Northern Ireland or no seat has been designated or determined— (a) section 43 (securing the attendance of witnesses), and (b) section 44 (court powers exercisable in support of arbitral proceedings); but the court may refuse to exercise any such power if, in the opinion of the court, the fact that the seat of the arbitration is outside England and Wales or Northern Ireland, or that when designated or determined the seat is likely to be outside England and Wales or Northern Ireland, makes it inappropriate to do so. (4) The court may exercise a power conferred by any provision of this Part not mentioned in subsection (2) or (3) for the purpose of supporting the arbitral process where— (a) no seat of the arbitration has been designated or determined, and (b) by reason of a connection with England and Wales or Northern Ireland the court is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so. (5) Section 7 (separability of arbitration agreement) and section 8 (death of a party) apply where the law applicable to the arbitration agreement is the law of England and Wales or Northern Ireland even if the seat of the arbitration is outside England and Wales or Northern Ireland or has not been designated or determined.</p>

<p>F1 S. 2(2)(za) inserted (1.8.2025) by Arbitration Act 2025 (c. 4), ss. 1(3), 17(2); S.I. 2025/905, reg. 2 3 The seat of the arbitration. In this Part “the seat of the arbitration” means the juridical seat of the arbitration designated— (a) by the parties to the arbitration agreement, or (b) by any arbitral or other institution or person vested by the parties with powers in that regard, or (c) by the arbitral tribunal if so authorised by the parties, or determined, in the absence of any such designation, having regard to the parties’ agreement and all the relevant circumstances. 4 Mandatory and non-mandatory provisions. (1) The mandatory provisions of this Part are listed in Schedule 1 and have effect notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary. (2) The other provisions of this Part (the “non-mandatory provisions”) allow the parties to make their own arrangements by agreement but provide rules which apply in the absence of such agreement. (3) The parties may make such arrangements by agreeing to the application of institutional rules or providing any other means by which a matter may be decided. (4) It is immaterial whether or not the law applicable to the parties’ agreement is the law of England and Wales or, as the case may be, Northern Ireland. (5) The choice of a law other than the law of England and Wales or Northern Ireland as the applicable law in respect of a matter provided for by a non-mandatory provision of this Part is equivalent to an agreement making provision about that matter. For this purpose an applicable law determined in accordance with the parties’ agreement, or which is objectively determined in the absence of any express or implied choice, shall be treated as chosen by the parties. 5 Agreements to be in writing. (1) The provisions of this Part apply only where the arbitration agreement is in writing, and any other agreement between the parties as to any matter is effective for the purposes of this Part only if in writing. The expressions “agreement”, “agree” and “agreed” shall be construed accordingly. (2) There is an agreement in writing— (a) if the agreement is made in writing (whether or not it is signed by the parties), (b) if the agreement is made by exchange of communications in writing, or (c) if the agreement is evidenced in writing. (3) Where parties agree otherwise than in writing by reference to terms which are in writing, they make an agreement in writing.</p>

<p>effects for the Arbitration Act 1996. (4) An agreement is evidenced in writing if an agreement made otherwise than in writing is recorded by one of the parties, or by a third party, with the authority of the parties to the agreement. (5) An exchange of written submissions in arbitral or legal proceedings in which the existence of an agreement otherwise than in writing is alleged by one party against another party and not denied by the other party in his response constitutes as between those parties an agreement in writing to the effect alleged. (6) References in this Part to anything being written or in writing include its being recorded by any means. The arbitration agreement 6 Definition of arbitration agreement. (1) In this Part an “arbitration agreement” means an agreement to submit to arbitration present or future disputes (whether they are contractual or not). (2) The reference in an agreement to a written form of arbitration clause or to a document containing an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement if the reference is such as to make that clause part of the agreement.</p>
<h3 class="doc-h3">[F26A</h3>
<p>Law applicable to arbitration agreement (1) The law applicable to an arbitration agreement is— (a) the law that the parties expressly agree applies to the arbitration agreement, or (b) where no such agreement is made, the law of the seat of the arbitration in question. (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), agreement between the parties that a particular law applies to an agreement of which the arbitration agreement forms a part does not constitute express agreement that that law also applies to the arbitration agreement. (3) Subsection (1) does not apply to an arbitration agreement derived from a standing offer to submit disputes to arbitration where the offer is contained in— (a) a treaty, or (b) legislation of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom. (4) In this section— “legislation” includes any provision of a legislative character; “treaty” includes any international agreement (and any protocol or annex to a treaty or international agreement).] Textual Amendments</p>

<p>effects for the Arbitration Act 1996. 7 Separability of arbitration agreement. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an arbitration agreement which forms or was intended to form part of another agreement (whether or not in writing) shall not be regarded as invalid, non-existent or ineffective because that other agreement is invalid, or did not come into existence or has become ineffective, and it shall for that purpose be treated as a distinct agreement. 8 Whether agreement discharged by death of a party. (1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an arbitration agreement is not discharged by the death of a party and may be enforced by or against the personal representatives of that party. (2) Subsection (1) does not affect the operation of any enactment or rule of law by virtue of which a substantive right or obligation is extinguished by death. Stay of legal proceedings 9 Stay of legal proceedings. (1) A party to an arbitration agreement against whom legal proceedings are brought (whether by way of claim or counterclaim) in respect of a matter which under the agreement is to be referred to arbitration may (upon notice to the other parties to the proceedings) apply to the court in which the proceedings have been brought to stay the proceedings so far as they concern that matter. (2) An application may be made notwithstanding that the matter is to be referred to arbitration only after the exhaustion of other dispute resolution procedures. (3) An application may not be made by a person before taking the appropriate procedural step (if any) to acknowledge the legal proceedings against him or after he has taken any step in those proceedings to answer the substantive claim. (4) On an application under this section the court shall grant a stay unless satisfied that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative, or incapable of being performed. (5) If the court refuses to stay the legal proceedings, any provision that an award is a condition precedent to the bringing of legal proceedings in respect of any matter is of no effect in relation to those proceedings. 10 Reference of interpleader issue to arbitration. (1) Where in legal proceedings relief by way of interpleader is granted and any issue between the claimants is one in respect of which there is an arbitration agreement between them, the court granting the relief shall direct that the issue be determined in accordance with the agreement unless the circumstances are such that proceedings brought by a claimant in respect of the matter would not be stayed. (2) Where subsection (1) applies but the court does not direct that the issue be determined in accordance with the arbitration agreement, any provision that an award is a condition precedent to the bringing of legal proceedings in respect of any matter shall not affect the determination of that issue by the court.</p>

<p>effects for the Arbitration Act 1996. 11 Retention of security where Admiralty proceedings stayed. (1) Where Admiralty proceedings are stayed on the ground that the dispute in question should be submitted to arbitration, the court granting the stay may, if in those proceedings property has been arrested or bail or other security has been given to prevent or obtain release from arrest— (a) order that the property arrested be retained as security for the satisfaction of any award given in the arbitration in respect of that dispute, or (b) order that the stay of those proceedings be conditional on the provision of equivalent security for the satisfaction of any such award. (2) Subject to any provision made by rules of court and to any necessary modifications, the same law and practice shall apply in relation to property retained in pursuance of an order as would apply if it were held for the purposes of proceedings in the court making the order. Commencement of arbitral proceedings 12 Power of court to extend time for beginning arbitral proceedings, &amp;c. (1) Where an arbitration agreement to refer future disputes to arbitration provides that a claim shall be barred, or the claimant’s right extinguished, unless the claimant takes within a time fixed by the agreement some step— (a) to begin arbitral proceedings, or (b) to begin other dispute resolution procedures which must be exhausted before arbitral proceedings can be begun, the court may by order extend the time for taking that step. (2) Any party to the arbitration agreement may apply for such an order (upon notice to the other parties), but only after a claim has arisen and after exhausting any available arbitral process for obtaining an extension of time. (3) The court shall make an order only if satisfied— (a) that the circumstances are such as were outside the reasonable contemplation of the parties when they agreed the provision in question, and that it would be just to extend the time, or (b) that the conduct of one party makes it unjust to hold the other party to the strict terms of the provision in question. (4) The court may extend the time for such period and on such terms as it thinks fit, and may do so whether or not the time previously fixed (by agreement or by a previous order) has expired. (5) An order under this section does not affect the operation of the Limitation Acts (see section 13). (6) The leave of the court is required for any appeal from a decision of the court under this section. 13 Application of Limitation Acts. (1) The Limitation Acts apply to arbitral proceedings as they apply to legal proceedings.</p>

(2) The court may order that in computing the time prescribed by the Limitation Acts for the commencement of proceedings (including arbitral proceedings) in respect of a dispute which was the subject matter— (a) of an award which the court orders to be set aside or declares to be of no effect, or (b) of the affected part of an award which the court orders to be set aside in part, or declares to be in part of no effect, the period between the commencement of the arbitration and the date of the order referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) shall be excluded. (3) In determining for the purposes of the Limitation Acts when a cause of action accrued, any provision that an award is a condition precedent to the bringing of legal proceedings in respect of a matter to which an arbitration agreement applies shall be disregarded. (4) In this Part “the Limitation Acts” means— (a) in England and Wales, the M1Limitation Act 1980, the M2Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984 and any other enactment (whenever passed) relating to the limitation of actions; (b) in Northern Ireland, the M3Limitation (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, the M4Foreign Limitation Periods (Northern Ireland) Order 1985 and any other enactment (whenever passed) relating to the limitation of actions.

(3) The arbitral tribunal may admit an objection later than the time specified in subsection (1) or (2) if it considers the delay justified. (4) Where an objection is duly taken to the tribunal’s substantive jurisdiction and the tribunal has power to rule on its own jurisdiction, it may— (a) rule on the matter in an award as to jurisdiction, or (b) deal with the objection in its award on the merits.

<p>1 Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 16 December 2013 [on the report of the Sixth Committee (A/68/462)] 68/109.  United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration and Arbitration Rules (as revised in 2010, with new article 1, paragraph 4, as adopted in 2013)</p>
<p>The General Assembly,</p>
<p>Recalling its resolution 2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966, by which it established the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law with a mandate to further the progres- sive harmonization and unification of the law of international trade and in that respect to bear in mind the interests of all peoples, in particular those of developing countries, in the extensive development of international trade,</p>
<p>Recognizing the value of arbitration as a method of settling disputes that may arise in the context of international relations and the wide use of arbitration for the settlement of treaty-based investor-State disputes,</p>
<p>Recalling its resolutions 31/98 of 15 December 1976 and 65/22 of 6 December 2010, in which it recommended the use of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law,1</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that the Arbitration Rules are widely used for the settlement of treaty-based investor-State disputes,</p>
<p>Recognizing the need for provisions on transparency in the settlement of such treaty-based investor-State disputes to take account of the public interest involved in such arbitrations,</p>
<p>Believing that rules on transparency in treaty-based investor- State arbitration would contribute significantly to the establish- ment of a harmonized legal framework for a fair and efficient</p>

<p>2 settlement of international investment disputes, increase trans- parency and accountability and promote good governance,</p>
<p>Noting that the Commission, at its forty-sixth session, adopted the Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor- State Arbitration2 and amended the Arbitration Rules as revised in 2010 to include, in a new article 1, paragraph 4, a reference to the Rules on Transparency,3</p>
<p>Noting also that the Rules on Transparency are available for use in investor-State arbitrations initiated under rules other than the Arbitration Rules or in ad hoc proceedings,</p>
<p>Noting further that the preparation of the Rules on ­Transparency was the subject of due deliberation in the ­Commission and that they benefited from consultations with Governments and interested intergovernmental and international non-governmental organizations,</p>

<p>3 than that provided in the Rules on Transparency, the Rules be applied through appropriate mechanisms to investor-State arbi- tration initiated pursuant to treaties providing for the protection of investors or investments concluded before the date of coming into effect of the Rules, to the extent that such application is consistent with those treaties. 68th plenary meeting 16 December 2013</p>
<p>5 UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration Article 1.  Scope of application Applicability of the Rules 1. The UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration (“Rules on Transparency”) shall apply to investor-State arbitration initiated under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules pursuant to a treaty providing for the pro­ tection of investments or investors (“treaty”)* concluded on or after 1 April 2014 unless the Parties to the treaty** have agreed otherwise. 2. In investor-State arbitrations initiated under the ­UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules pursuant to a treaty concluded before 1 April 2014, these Rules shall apply only when:</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(a)</span><p>The parties to an arbitration (the “disputing parties”)</p></div>
<p>agree to their application in respect of that arbitration; or</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(b)</span><p>The Parties to the treaty or, in the case of a multi­</p></div>
<p>lateral treaty, the State of the claimant and the respondent State, have agreed after 1 April 2014 to their application. Application of the Rules 3. In any arbitration in which the Rules on Transparency apply pursuant to a treaty or to an agreement by the Parties to that treaty:</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(a)</span><p>The disputing parties may not derogate from these</p></div>
<p>Rules, by agreement or otherwise, unless permitted to do so by the treaty;</p>
<p>*For the purposes of the Rules on Transparency, a “treaty” shall be under- stood broadly as encompassing any bilateral or multilateral treaty that contains provisions on the protection of investments or investors and a right for investors to resort to arbitration against Parties to the treaty, including any treaty commonly referred to as a free trade agreement, economic integration agreement, trade and investment framework or cooperation agreement, or bilateral investment treaty.</p>
<p>**For the purposes of the Rules on Transparency, any reference to a “Party to the treaty” or a “State” includes, for example, a regional economic integration organization where it is a Party to the treaty.</p>
<p>6</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(b)</span><p>The arbitral tribunal shall have the power, besides its</p></div>
<p>discretionary authority under certain provisions of these Rules, to adapt the requirements of any specific provision of these Rules to the particular circumstances of the case, after consulta- tion with the disputing parties, if such adaptation is necessary to conduct the arbitration in a practical manner and is consistent with the transparency objective of these Rules. Discretion and authority of the arbitral tribunal 4. Where the Rules on Transparency provide for the arbitral tribunal to exercise discretion, the arbitral tribunal in exercising such discretion shall take into account:</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(a)</span><p>The public interest in transparency in treaty-based</p></div>
<p>investor-State arbitration and in the particular arbitral proceed- ings; and</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(b)</span><p>The disputing parties’ interest in a fair and efficient</p></div>
<p>resolution of their dispute. 5. These Rules shall not affect any authority that the arbitral tribunal may otherwise have under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules to conduct the arbitration in such a manner as to promote transparency, for example by accepting submissions from third persons. 6. In the presence of any conduct, measure or other action having the effect of wholly undermining the transparency objec- tives of these Rules, the arbitral tribunal shall ensure that those objectives prevail. Applicable instrument in case of conflict 7. Where the Rules on Transparency apply, they shall sup- plement any applicable arbitration rules. Where there is a con- flict between the Rules on Transparency and the applicable arbitration rules, the Rules on Transparency shall prevail. Not- withstanding any provision in these Rules, where there is a conflict between the Rules on Transparency and the treaty, the provisions of the treaty shall prevail. 8. Where any of these Rules is in conflict with a provision of the law applicable to the arbitration from which the disputing parties cannot derogate, that provision shall prevail.</p>
<p>7 Application in non-UNCITRAL arbitrations 9. These Rules are available for use in investor-State arbi­ trations initiated under rules other than the UNCITRAL ­Arbitration Rules or in ad hoc proceedings. Article 2.  Publication of information at the commencement of arbitral proceedings Once the notice of arbitration has been received by the respond- ent, each of the disputing parties shall promptly communicate a copy of the notice of arbitration to the repository referred to under article 8. Upon receipt of the notice of arbitration from the respondent, or upon receipt of the notice of arbitration and a record of its transmission to the respondent, the repository shall promptly make available to the public information ­regarding the name of the disputing parties, the economic ­sector  involved and the treaty under which the claim is being made. Article 3.  Publication of documents 1. Subject to article 7, the following documents shall be made available to the public: the notice of arbitration, the response to the notice of arbitration, the statement of claim, the statement of defence and any further written statements or written sub­ missions by any disputing party; a table listing all exhibits to the aforesaid documents and to expert reports and witness ­statements, if such table has been prepared for the proceedings, but not the exhibits themselves; any written submissions by the non-disputing Party (or Parties) to the treaty and by third ­persons, transcripts of hearings, where available; and orders, decisions and awards of the arbitral tribunal. 2. Subject to article 7, expert reports and witness statements, exclusive of the exhibits thereto, shall be made available to the public, upon request by any person to the arbitral tribunal. 3. Subject to article 7, the arbitral tribunal may decide, on its own initiative or upon request from any person, and after consultation with the disputing parties, whether and how to make available exhibits and any other documents provided to, or issued by, the arbitral tribunal not falling within paragraphs 1 or 2 above. This may include, for example, making such docu- ments available at a specified site.</p>
<p>8 4. The documents to be made available to the public pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be communicated by the arbitral tribunal to the repository referred to under article 8 as soon as possible, subject to any relevant arrangements or time limits for the protection of confidential or protected information pre- scribed under article 7. The documents to be made available pursuant to paragraph 3 may be communicated by the arbitral tribunal to the repository referred to under article 8 as they become available and, if applicable, in a redacted form in accordance with article 7. The repository shall make all docu- ments available in a timely manner, in the form and in the language in which it receives them. 5. A person granted access to documents under paragraph 3 shall bear any administrative costs of making those documents available to that person, such as the costs of photocopying or shipping documents to that person, but not the costs of making those documents available to the public through the repository. Article 4.  Submission by a third person</p>
<div class="para-block" id="para-uncitral_transparency-1"><span class="para-num">1.</span><p>After consultation with the disputing parties, the arbi- tral tribunal may allow a person that is not a disputing party, and not a non-disputing Party to the treaty (“third person(s)”), to file a written submission with the arbitral tribunal regarding a matter within the scope of the dispute.</p></div>
<div class="para-block" id="para-uncitral_transparency-2"><span class="para-num">2.</span><p>A third person wishing to make a submission shall apply to the arbitral tribunal, and shall, in a concise written statement, which is in a language of the arbitration and complies with any page limits set by the arbitral tribunal:</p></div>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(a)</span><p>Describe the third person, including, where relevant,</p></div>
<p>its membership and legal status (e.g., trade association or other non-governmental organization), its general objectives, the nature of its activities and any parent organization (including any organization that directly or indirectly controls the third person);</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(b)</span><p>Disclose any connection, direct or indirect, which the</p></div>
<p>third person has with any disputing party;</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(c)</span><p>Provide information on any government, person or</p></div>
<p>organization that has provided to the third person (i) any finan- cial or other assistance in preparing the submission; or (ii) substantial assistance in either of the two years preceding the application by the third person under this article (e.g. funding around 20 per cent of its overall operations annually);</p>
<p>9</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(d)</span><p>Describe the nature of the interest that the third person</p></div>
<p>has in the arbitration; and</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(e)</span><p>Identify the specific issues of fact or law in the arbi-</p></div>
<p>tration that the third person wishes to address in its written submission. 3. In determining whether to allow such a submission, the arbitral tribunal shall take into consideration, among other ­factors it determines to be relevant:</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(a)</span><p>Whether the third person has a significant interest in</p></div>
<p>the arbitral proceedings; and</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(b)</span><p>The extent to which the submission would assist the</p></div>
<p>arbitral tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the arbitral proceedings by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties. 4. The submission filed by the third person shall:</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(a)</span><p>Be dated and signed by the person filing the submis-</p></div>
<p>sion on behalf of the third person;</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(b)</span><p>Be concise, and in no case longer than as authorized</p></div>
<p>by the arbitral tribunal;</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(c)</span><p>Set out a precise statement of the third person’s posi-</p></div>
<p>tion on issues; and</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(d)</span><p>Address only matters within the scope of the dispute.</p></div>
<p>5. The arbitral tribunal shall ensure that any submission does not disrupt or unduly burden the arbitral proceedings, or unfairly prejudice any disputing party. 6. The arbitral tribunal shall ensure that the disputing parties are given a reasonable opportunity to present their observations on any submission by the third person. Article 5.  Submission by a non-disputing Party to the treaty 1. The arbitral tribunal shall, subject to paragraph 4, allow, or, after consultation with the disputing parties, may invite, submissions on issues of treaty interpretation from a non-­ disputing Party to the treaty. 2. The arbitral tribunal, after consultation with the disputing parties, may allow submissions on further matters within the</p>
<p>10 scope of the dispute from a non-disputing Party to the treaty. In determining whether to allow such submissions, the arbitral tribunal shall take into consideration, among other factors it determines to be relevant, the factors referred to in article 4, paragraph 3, and, for greater certainty, the need to avoid sub- missions which would support the claim of the investor in a manner tantamount to diplomatic protection. 3. The arbitral tribunal shall not draw any inference from the absence of any submission or response to any invitation ­pursuant to paragraphs 1 or 2. 4. The arbitral tribunal shall ensure that any submission does not disrupt or unduly burden the arbitral proceedings, or unfairly prejudice any disputing party. 5. The arbitral tribunal shall ensure that the disputing parties are given a reasonable opportunity to present their observations on any submission by a non-disputing Party to the treaty. Article 6.  Hearings 1. Subject to article 6, paragraphs 2 and 3, hearings for the presentation of evidence or for oral argument (“hearings”) shall be public. 2. Where there is a need to protect confidential information or the integrity of the arbitral process pursuant to article 7, the arbitral tribunal shall make arrangements to hold in private that part of the hearing requiring such protection. 3. The arbitral tribunal shall make logistical arrangements to facilitate the public access to hearings (including where appro- priate by organizing attendance through video links or such other means as it deems appropriate). However, the arbitral tribunal may, after consultation with the disputing parties, decide to hold all or part of the hearings in private where this becomes necessary for logistical reasons, such as when the cir- cumstances render any original arrangement for public access to a hearing infeasible. Article 7.  Exceptions to transparency Confidential or protected information 1. Confidential or protected information, as defined in para- graph 2 and as identified pursuant to the arrangements referred</p>
<p>11 to in paragraphs 3 and 4, shall not be made available to the public pursuant to articles 2 to 6. 2. Confidential or protected information consists of:</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(a)</span><p>Confidential business information;</p></div>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(b)</span><p>Information that is protected against being made</p></div>
<p>available to the public under the treaty;</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(c)</span><p>Information that is protected against being made</p></div>
<p>available to the public, in the case of the information of the respondent State, under the law of the respondent State, and in the case of other information, under any law or rules determined by the arbitral tribunal to be applicable to the disclosure of such information; or</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(d)</span><p>Information the disclosure of which would impede</p></div>
<p>law enforcement. 3. The arbitral tribunal, after consultation with the disputing parties, shall make arrangements to prevent any confidential or protected information from being made available to the public, including by putting in place, as appropriate:</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(a)</span><p>Time limits in which a disputing party, non-disputing</p></div>
<p>Party to the treaty or third person shall give notice that it seeks protection for such information in documents;</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(b)</span><p>Procedures for the prompt designation and redaction</p></div>
<p>of the particular confidential or protected information in such documents; and</p>
<div class="sub-para"><span class="sub-num">(c)</span><p>Procedures for holding hearings in private to the</p></div>
<p>extent required by article 6, paragraph 2. Any determination as to whether information is confidential or protected shall be made by the arbitral tribunal after consulta- tion with the disputing parties. 4. Where the arbitral tribunal determines that information should not be redacted from a document, or that a document should not be prevented from being made available to the ­public, any disputing party, non-disputing Party to the treaty or third person that voluntarily introduced the document into the record shall be permitted to withdraw all or part of the docu- ment from the record of the arbitral proceedings. 5. Nothing in these Rules requires a respondent State to make available to the public information the disclosure of which it considers to be contrary to its essential security interests.</p>

Information shall not be made available to the public pur- suant to articles 2 to 6 where the information, if made available to the public, would jeopardize the integrity of the arbitral ­process as determined pursuant to paragraph 7. 7. The arbitral tribunal may, on its own initiative or upon the application of a disputing party, after consultation with the ­disputing parties where practicable, take appropriate measures to restrain or delay the publication of information where such publication would jeopardize the integrity of the arbitral process because it could hamper the collection or production of evi- dence, lead to the intimidation of witnesses, lawyers acting for disputing parties or members of the arbitral tribunal, or in ­comparably exceptional circumstances. Article 8.  Repository of published information The repository of published information under the Rules on Transparency shall be the Secretary-General of the United Nations or an institution named by UNCITRAL.</p>
